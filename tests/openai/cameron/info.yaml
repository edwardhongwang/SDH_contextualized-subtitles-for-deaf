  1  
  00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,420  
  The ocean,

  2  
  00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,220  
  the last frontier on Earth,

  3  
  00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,300  
  so much is unexplored

  4  
  00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,740  
  and unexplained.

  5  
  00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,980  
  To change that,

  6  
  00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,260  
  an exceptional team of incredibly talented specialists

  00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,575  
  is setting out to push the frontiers

  8  
  00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:19,535  
  of what we know about our oceans.

  9  
  00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,335  
  Oh my God.

  Zoleka Filander,

  11  
  00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,375  
  deep-sea scientist.

  12  
  00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:29,955  
  Being a deep-sea researcher means having front-row tickets

  13  
  00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,570  
  to the best movie that everybody wants to watch.

  14

  00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,010  
  shark biologist.

  16  
  00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,090  
  "Straight ahead, 12 o'clock."

  17  
  00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,090  
  "We just saw what no one has seen before."

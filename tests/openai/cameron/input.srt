00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,220
the last frontier on earth,

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,300
so much is unexplored

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,740
and unexplained.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,980

is setting out to push the frontiers

8
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:19,535
of what we know about our oceans.

9

12
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:28,955
Being a deep sea researcher means having front

13
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:29,610
row tickets

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,570

15
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,070

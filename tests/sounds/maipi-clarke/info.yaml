    The only reason this parliament exists in Aotearoa

    2
    00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,080
    is because our tipuna consented to it. The

    3
    00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,240
    only people who can make changes in an

    4
    00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,420
    agreement are the parties who signed it.

    00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,695
    Hannah Rafi Tmai P. Clark began the haka

    6
    00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:24,935
    after being asked whether her party supported the

    7
    00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:27,655
    bill. At 22, she is the youngest member

    8
    00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:29,520
    of the New Zealand parliament. When the haka

    9
    00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,260
    starts, you can hear an exasperated Jerry Brownlee,

    10
    00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,080
    the speaker of the New Zealand House of

    11
    00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,360
    Representatives saying, no. Don't do that. She rips

    12
    00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,600
    a copy of the controversial bill in half

    13
    00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,715
    and then throws it on the floor. Other

    14
    00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:43,895
    Maori MPs join her in the haka.

    15
    00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,195
    The bill is unlikely to pass, but thousands

    16
    00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:52,915
    of protesters supporting the Maori cause are still

    17
    00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:56,115
    marching to Wellington, the country's capital. Their 9

    18
    00:00:56,115 --> 00:00:59,260
    day march is expected to conclude on Tuesday.

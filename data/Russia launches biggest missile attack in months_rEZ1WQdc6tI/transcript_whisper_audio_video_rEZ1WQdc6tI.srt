1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,440
This was a massive attack across the country

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,500
this morning. More than 200 missiles and drones,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,440
not targeting the military though, but ordinary civilians.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,560
Families who are now gonna struggle with shortages

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,280
of power and heating as temperatures here start

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,880
to plummet.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,300
This morning, Russia launching 1 of its largest

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,820
attacks against Ukraine in months, missiles targeting power

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,220
plants and energy infrastructure

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,620
across the country,

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,780
sending people fleeing to metro stations and shelters.

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,260
The grid in Kiev and at least 1

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,080
other region forced to shut down, and Poland's

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,660
military scrambling its air force in response to

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,260
the attack.

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,600
The strikes signaling Russia's threat to leave millions

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,400
without power as freezing temperatures begin to grip

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:42,900
Ukraine.

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,920
Amid escalating attacks and Russian advances on the

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,420
battlefield,

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,140
intense conversations about possible negotiations to end this

22
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,140
war once president-elect Donald Trump takes office.

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,480
Ukrainian President Zelensky says he believes the end

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,540
of the war will be closer after Trump's

25
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,040
inauguration,

26
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,440
saying the war will end, but there's no

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,740
exact date. Certainly, with the policy of this

28
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,560
team that's about to lead the White House,

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,980
the war will end faster.

30
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,200
But Zelensky also warning that Ukraine must be

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,040
kept in a strong position and that the

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,600
US can't expect them to just Sit and

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,100
listen.

1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,400
The ocean.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,240
The last frontier on Earth.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,220
So much is unexplored

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,720
and unexplained.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,080
To change that,

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,280
a kick-ass team of insanely talented specialists

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,620
is setting out to push the frontiers

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,280
of what we know

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,580
about our oceans.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,520
Oh my gosh.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,900
Zolekha Philander,

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,660
deep sea scientist.

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,160
Being a deep sea researcher means having front

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,300
row tickets to the best movie that everybody

15
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,280
wants to watch.

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,560
Melissa Marquez.

17
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,160
Straight ahead, 12 o'clock.

18
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,400
Shark biologist.

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,300
We just saw what no 1 has seen

20
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,800
before.

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,320
Eric Stackpole.

22
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,120
Scan now. Ocean tech innovator. I love building

23
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,420
tools that allow us to see things in

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,900
ways we've never seen before.

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,240
And Aldo Kane,

26
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,880
former Royal Marine Special Ops.

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,400
It doesn't get any more cutting edge exploration

28
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,580
than this. Their secret weapon,

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,360
the Ocean Explorer.

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,020
The most technologically advanced research vessel ever

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,320
built.

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,480
There's never been a more urgent need to

33
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,940
understand our ocean

34
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,780
and the animals that call it home,

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,160
because their lives

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,500
and ours

37
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,140
depend on it.

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,740
OK, here we go. 2 o'clock, 2 o'clock.

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,220
This time, the team tracks sperm whales

40
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,460
down into an alien world...

41
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,680
What is that?

42
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,060
...Full of fantastical

43
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:37,960
creatures.

44
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,620
No!

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,160
The ocean explorer is heading for deep water,

46
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,480
just off the Azores,

47
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,340
a chain of tiny volcanic

48
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,880
in the middle of the Atlantic,

49
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,560
and a rich oasis

50
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,140
for an abundance of marine life. Music

51
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,080
music

52
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,440
music Every summer, nearly a thousand sperm whales

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
gather here.

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,020
They're easily identified by their distinctive sideways

55
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,840
spout.

56
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,580
These whales spend most of their lives deep

57
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,540
below the surface.

58
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,700
But using the full scope of the Ocean

59
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,900
Explorers' tech,

60
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,280
the team hopes to shine a light on

61
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,060
their lives

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,980
down in these black depths.

63
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,780
Stand by at 09:00. Stand by at 9

64
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,280
o'clock.

65
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,120
Sperm whales were hunted here as recently as

66
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,620
1987,

67
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,800
and they live up to 70 years, so

68
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,740
some of them may still remember that.

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,340
They're understandably

70
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,040
nervous around boats,

71
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,760
So Aldo and Melissa approach cautiously.

72
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,660
You got your eyes on them?

73
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,540
They're sneaky, I tell you.

74
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,480
Oh! 0, my god, they're right underneath us.

75
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,500
They're right underneath us.

76
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,220
Wow, look at that.

77
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,100
It's a whole family pod.

78
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,030
That's

79
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,500
gorgeous. That is a first for me.

80
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,840
Yeah. Sperm whales are the largest toothed predator

81
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,740
on the planet. Predator on the planet.

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,520
To study these giants up close and personal,

83
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,780
Aldo and Melissa join them beneath the waves.

84
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,740
Getting under the water and just seeing this

85
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,720
giant animal,

86
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,100
you can feel it

87
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,600
looking at you,

88
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,040
trying to figure out what the heck you

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,540
are.

90
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,620
But they won't have long.

91
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,160
Sperm whales spend just 20% of their lives

92
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,980
at the surface.

93
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,540
When they dive, it's phenomenal. When they dive,

94
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,560
it's phenomenal.

95
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,260
1 swoosh of their tail and they are

96
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,760
gone.

97
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,340
These whales are diving a mile deep for

98
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,020
up to an hour at a time.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,180
The buoyancy of their huge lungs and the

100
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,820
thick blubber should make that almost impossible.

101
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,900
But not only do they manage it, they

102
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,020
make it look effortless.

103
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,760
Cuckoo

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,500
clock

105
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,400
ticking But exactly how they dive so deep

106
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,860
has never been filmed.

107
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,980
If the team can get a camera on

108
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,360
a whale, It could further their understanding.

109
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,120
They recruit the help of Rui Prieto,

110
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,580
a world-leading whale

111
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,420
biologist. He's been studying them in the Azores

112
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,840
for over 20 years.

113
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,300
We want to see

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,240
what they are actually doing

115
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,300
while they are underwater.

116
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,720
Eric sets to work helping Rui build a

117
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,560
camera tag that can withstand the immense pressure

118
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,200
of a sperm whale dive.

119
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,940
OK, so this is the power system.

120
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,980
And then

121
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,140
we've just got the little camera. You know,

122
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,760
the whole thing looks pretty simple. But I

123
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,160
mean, the thing that keeps going through my

124
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,980
mind is, you know, we're going to have

125
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,020
maybe 1 window

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
and 1 chance of putting this together the

127
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,400
right way. So do you think that's something

128
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,380
we can do? Fingers crossed, right? I guess

129
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,340
we'll find out.

130
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,920
If they can pull this off, they'll get

131
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,680
the first-ever

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,560
footage of a deep sperm whale dive in

133
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,540
the Azores. Yeah.

134
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,740
Let's turn a whale into a cameraman.

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,740
You have a green light.

136
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,120
Copy, green light. Good deck, We're off.

137
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,280
We need to start looking for blows.

138
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

139
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,475
Looks like there could be something over there.

140
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,200
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

141
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,740
I count 11 whales here, all in a

142
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,200
tight cluster. OK, here we go. 2 o'clock,

143
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,820
2 o'clock.

144
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,320
You should have a pretty good eye, 300,

145
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,420
400 meters.

146
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,060
Breaching.

147
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,700
No!

148
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,800
We think breaching might be a form of

149
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,840
communication between a sperm whale family. However, sometimes

150
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,140
it might just be the teenagers fooling around

151
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,940
and, you know, blowing off some steam.

152
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,120
Let's go there very slowly.

153
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,380
Slow and steady wins the race.

154
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,560
Is that speed OK? Need to gain a

155
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,400
little bit on them, because they are almost

156
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,900
diving.

157
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,740
When you're piloting a boat this close to

158
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,240
Wales,

159
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,380
there's absolutely

160
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,180
no room for error.

161
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,620
You're dealing with a live animal, so the

162
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,720
whole thing has to be 110%

163
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,900
perfect, or it's an aborted mission.

164
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,380
That's it.

165
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,320
Well done.

166
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,660
Well done, dude. Tag on.

167
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,820
Ocean Explorer, this is Eagle Ray, over. Eagle

168
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,460
Ray, Ocean Explorer, go ahead.

169
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,620
Tag deployed and we will mark location on

170
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,280
the GPS.

171
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,060
Copy that. Nice work.

172
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,760
The tag is designed to release after 8

173
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,900
hours and send a signal to help the

174
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,180
team locate it,

175
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,040
somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic.

176
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,080
It is an intense feeling to spend all

177
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,440
this time on something and then watch it

178
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,420
just go into the abyss on the back

179
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,180
of a whale.

180
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,650
Oh, what's this direction in front of us?

181
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,160
Confirm you

182
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:50,910
have

183
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
visual on the tag. Affirmative.

184
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,800
We're looking at something orange

185
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,280
in the water. It could

186
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,640
be the tag.

187
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,160
Roger that. We are making our way to

188
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,820
your location now. Over.

189
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,100
Oh, I see it.

190
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,040
We have visual on the tag.

191
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,120
Little bit more, Aldo. Yeah, there you go.

192
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,840
Right there.

193
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,160
You got it? Yeah, got it.

194
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,460
I'm dying to know, how does a tag

195
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:23,960
look?

196
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,600
The tag does look in good condition, and

197
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,340
the camera looks like it's still dry. Yes.

198
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,860
All right, great job, guys.

199
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Should I cut this? Yes, please.

200
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,040
Now it could be some water inside, so

201
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,220
we need to be careful.

202
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,140
Very slowly,

203
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,420
very carefully.

204
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,810
I'm like excited and nervous at the same

205
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,300
time, you know, like, did everything work properly?

206
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,740
Did the batteries last? Yes, yes.

207
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,760
Got it? Take it off.

208
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,480
It's dry.

209
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,360
OK. And then there's our SD card.

210
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,840
You got it? I got it. This is

211
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,340
it.

212
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,220
This is what we've been working all this

213
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,740
time for. Let's plug this to the computer

214
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,820
and see. Okay, yeah. Okay.

215
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,160
Anything that comes off this thing is new.

216
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,500
Oh my god!

217
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,460
That's the blowhole.

218
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,180
And it's going down because it's getting darker.

219
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,020
As they dive, sperm whales undergo an incredible

220
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,560
transformation.

221
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,700
The pressure of the water compresses their lungs.

222
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,580
And with less volume inside,

223
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,440
they become less buoyant,

224
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,100
allowing them to dive faster with minimum effort.

225
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,960
As she dives faster, the force of the

226
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,720
water pushes the camera sideways.

227
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,340
At 450

228
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,280
feet,

229
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,500
it flips.

230
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,020
It's pointing backwards? Yeah, it's pointing backwards.

231
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,840
We can actually see

232
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,560
the flukes beating.

233
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,980
Eric and Rui are the first people ever

234
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,260
to see a sperm whale use its body

235
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,100
and tail flukes to dive into the deep.

236
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,240
I'm learning a lot about how they actually

237
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,120
flex

238
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,680
their flukes.

239
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,560
It's very slow. It's very calm.

240
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,700
Then, at 900 feet, the whale's behavior changes.

241
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,900
Look. The tail stopped moving. Yeah. It's called

242
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,900
gliding. They use the

243
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,300
momentum that they have to glide and keep

244
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,560
energy. I see. And I've never seen it.

245
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,440
So

246
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,100
it's just amazing.

247
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,080
Its tail may have stopped moving, but this

248
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,340
whale is still diving.

249
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,760
With gravity doing the work, it can save

250
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,080
energy and preserve precious oxygen.

251
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,000
Listen.

252
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:19,830
It's

253
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,020
hunting. This is the hunting sound. Yeah.

254
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,020
Sperm whales use sound to hunt in the

255
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,520
dark.

256
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,080
When their sonar clicks hit an object and

257
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,980
bounce back,

258
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,760
the whale can locate a target over a

259
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,520
mile away.

260
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,260
It's getting lighter in the background. You notice

261
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,640
that? Yeah, the water is becoming clear.

262
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,700
No luck this time,

263
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,160
so the whale begins its journey back to

264
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,840
the surface.

265
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,620
I hear a different, slightly higher-pitched clicking. It

266
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,460
was a coda.

267
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,380
It's communicating with its family, just like Moore's

268
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,320
code for whales.

269
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,760
Another 1. Someone is answering.

270
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,020
Each family unit has a unique coda

271
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,860
that can be heard from up to 2

272
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,780
miles away.

273
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,420
Whoa, 2222,

274
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,460
another 1.

275
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,120
This is how a surfacing whale reconnects with

276
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,840
its family.

277
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,680
So you hear the codas, and then the

278
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,520
other 1 comes in. Yeah, yeah. Do we

279
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,780
know that they do this? We know that

280
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,540
they talk to each other using codas, but

281
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,860
I've never seen them come together.

282
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,800
They are completely interacting. They are completely interacting.

283
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,060
Nothing like that has ever been filmed.

284
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,980
It's just amazing.

285
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,220
We are seeing something that has never been

286
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,020
seen before.

287
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,880
These huge whales going to a part of

288
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,200
the world that we know almost nothing about,

289
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,460
and we get a first-person view. I'm right

290
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,740
next to Rui, and he's spent his entire

291
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,120
life trying to understand these animals, and this

292
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,820
is something he's never seen before.

293
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,320
Once back at the surface, some sperm whales

294
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,600
spend their time socializing,

295
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,000
reestablishing Reestablishing

296
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,420
family bonds.

297
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,120
Others

298
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,080
grab a quick power nap.

299
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,800
But their time together is brief.

300
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,300
After just 15 minutes, they'll dive again

301
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,780
in their never-ending pursuit of prey.

302
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,320
Sperm whales eat up to a ton of

303
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,420
squid a day.

304
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,480
And with nearly a thousand sperm whales here,

305
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,300
that's a lot of squid.

306
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,620
So what kind of squid are hiding down

307
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,760
there in the depths that could satisfy such

308
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,880
voracious appetites?

309
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,700
To find out, the team need to get

310
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,640
down there themselves.

311
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,740
MUSIC

312
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,740
The mission will be led by Zolekka,

313
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,400
the ocean explorer's deep sea researcher.

314
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,760
For this mission, I'm partnering with Edie Witter,

315
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,060
1 of the world's most experienced deep sea

316
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,560
biologists.

317
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,400
You ready to dive?

318
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,620
Yes.

319
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,300
So Neptune, we are ready to shut edges

320
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,060
So bridge you are clear to roll some

321
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,560
out

322
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,800
Edie's been pushing the envelope in ocean exploration

323
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,760
for over 40 years.

324
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,520
That's left-hand in the water.

325
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,800
Venting now.

326
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Depth to 0 meters, vent secure, descending, over.

327
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,220
Every time we dive into the deep, we

328
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,660
are heading into the unknown.

329
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,640
We are explorers

330
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,880
and this is our spaceship.

331
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,300
600 feet down the team enters the Twilight

332
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,820
Zone,

333
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,366
a world dominated by darkness a world dominated

334
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:23,980
by darkness

335
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,780
and alien creatures. Oh, look at that.

336
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,040
Look at that.

337
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,620
What are you seeing?

338
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,530
It's

339
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,440
a

340
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,350
glass

341
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,260
squid,

342
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,560
a rare sighting. Exciting.

343
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,880
Being transparent,

344
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,520
that's defense mechanism.

345
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,780
It's such an amazing adaptation.

346
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,840
You see it a lot in the ocean,

347
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,560
but you don't see it much on land.

348
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,960
At 1, 500 feet, they find even more

349
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
signs of life.

350
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,380
What is that?

351
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,280
What?

352
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,560
Look. Turn to the right. Turn to the

353
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,060
right.

354
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,060
It's ink, But it's so much. Oh, my

355
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,560
god.

356
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,200
Where is the squid, though?

357
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,580
Oh, squid. Squid.

358
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,300
A bird squid.

359
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,860
Hello.

360
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,780
Hello. And this 1 has attitude. Oh, my

361
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,960
gosh. It's winter. Beautiful.

362
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,320
Oh, look at him. He's not going anywhere.

363
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:55,880
Winter.

364
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,120
I think he's trying to eat Zalecka.

365
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,380
Yeah.

366
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:02,969
It's

367
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:04,557
good

368
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:06,146
food.

369
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:07,734
It's

370
00:21:08,823 --> 00:21:09,323
squid

371
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:10,911
food.

372
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,580
As the sub dives to 2, 500 feet,

373
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,080
Zaleckha

374
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,060
spots something extraordinary.

375
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,940
Oh, my word.

376
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,680
Is that a whiplash squid?

377
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,080
Look how exquisite it is.

378
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,400
All squid can change color by expanding or

379
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,400
contracting cells in their skin, called chromatophores.

380
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,700
Do you think

381
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,820
it's signaling

382
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,700
to other squid?

383
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,920
Is this an alarm signal?

384
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,740
How does 1 even decode

385
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,820
what we're really seeing here?

386
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,040
I'd like to think I'm a level-headed scientist,

387
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,680
but wow,

388
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,640
when you come across

389
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,400
an encounter like this,

390
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,360
it's absolutely stunning.

391
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,280
Absolutely

392
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,160
stunning.

393
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,180
This is why we do it, Edie.

394
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,000
Sperm whales do prey on whiplash squid, but

395
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,540
they're so small, they'd need to eat thousands

396
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,540
every day.

397
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,900
At 3, 300 feet, they approach the boundary

398
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,340
of the Midnight Zone.

399
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,760
The Midnight Zone is pitch black, and it's

400
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,260
freezing.

401
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,720
But as hostile as this place is, this

402
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,020
is where the sperm whale finds its food.

403
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,800
So it's important that we go take a

404
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,700
look down there.

405
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,480
But the sub reaches its maximum dive depth.

406
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,560
It can't go any farther.

407
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,920
Control, control.

408
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,600
Neptune passing 5, 0 meters clear to surface.

409
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,960
If they want to search the Midnight Zone

410
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,940
for larger sperm whale prey,

411
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,620
The team will have to mobilize the ship's

412
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,120
ROV,

413
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,080
a remotely operated vehicle.

414
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,480
The ROV is capable of going to depths

415
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,210
of 20, 000 feet, So getting to 5,

416
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,340
000 feet where the sperm whales are going

417
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,340
should be no problem at all.

418
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,660
Melissa baits the ROV with deep water squid's

419
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,640
favorite meal,

420
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,860
Other squid.

421
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,600
And that is a squid ready to be

422
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,300
lifelike

423
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,580
in the water column. The

424
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,060
the

425
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,020
the

426
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,740
the

427
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,040
the

428
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:21,960
the

429
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,020
the

430
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,180
Through its tether to the ship, the ROV

431
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,740
sends back a live picture.

432
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,680
Exploring the deep, you often see something that

433
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,960
you have never seen before, but you hope

434
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,280
that you're going to see something no 1

435
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,300
has seen before.

436
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,660
Lights off.

437
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,949
Oh, incoming, incoming. What's off? Oh, incoming, incoming.

438
00:24:58,102 --> 00:25:00,560
Here we go. Whoa.

439
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,620
What is

440
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,940
that? Bingo. Kitefin shark.

441
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,740
The

442
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,360
squid lure has drawn in

443
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,080
more than the team bargained for.

444
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,520
He looks like a good size.

445
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,860
These guys can get up to, like, 30

446
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,900
pounds on average.

447
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,660
Sperm whales, yeah, they do eat them, but

448
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,480
actually have a preference for squid.

449
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,440
After hours in the deep and just 1

450
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,020
encounter with the kite fin,

451
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,180
the team wonders if the noise from the

452
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,580
ROV could be scaring off the squid.

453
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Time to try a different approach.

454
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,850
Marine

455
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,760
biologist Nathan Robinson

456
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,200
has the perfect camera rig for this mission.

457
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,960
The Angler is a stealth camera, makes

458
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,960
no noise. It's also very

459
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,160
light sensitive. So this actually really is perfect

460
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,584
for seeing animals in the deep sea. In

461
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:16,360
the deep sea.

462
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,880
Going down.

463
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,160
Hey, keep letting it go.

464
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,740
Luring

465
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,620
The angler on a fishing line may look

466
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,220
low tech, but this is our secret weapon.

467
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,160
It can dive to 6, 500

468
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,880
feet

469
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,780
and then just sit there

470
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,260
completely silent and still

471
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,660
so as not to scare away any wildlife.

472
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,040
The angler is armed with an E-jelly,

473
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,180
an LED array that mimics the defense mechanism

474
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,560
of the Atolla jellyfish, which

475
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,040
lights up when threatened to try and attract

476
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,400
an even larger predator in the hope

477
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,220
that it will scare off the attacker.

478
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,040
After hours in the deep, the rig is

479
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,140
ready to be retrieved.

480
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,360
Only once back aboard will the team discover

481
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,620
if their covert mission has been a success.

482
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,660
All right, You ready to bring it to

483
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,900
the lab? Yeah.

484
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,280
OK, so now we're going down to the

485
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:03,780
bottom.

486
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,280
Oh, my God. What a catch.

487
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,000
These flying squid are known sperm whale prey.

488
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,300
We've been seeing a ton

489
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,020
of squid conducting these hit

490
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,480
and run attacks on the bait and the

491
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,020
E. Jellie.

492
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,940
They are large,

493
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,100
very nutritious

494
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,260
food items for something like a sperm whale.

495
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,580
Hours into the footage, Nathan and Eric spot

496
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,700
something even larger,

497
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,640
and they gather the rest of the team.

498
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,100
Just watch this.

499
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,280
That is a really big squid.

500
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,280
So this species is the third largest in

501
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,920
the oceans.

502
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,540
Dana octopus squid is the common name. It's

503
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,980
got light organs on the ends of its

504
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,480
arms

505
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,320
that are like the size of lemons.

506
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,620
Look at them. They're glowing so bright.

507
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,820
Why would you have such bright lights there?

508
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,700
To blind you. Like a deer in the

509
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,200
headlights.

510
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,660
So you've got your little critter, your little

511
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,160
crustacean that you want to eat.

512
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,540
You shine these big kind of lemon-sized lights

513
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,060
right out.

514
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,280
It can't see what's coming from what direction,

515
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,940
and then bam, you take it down.

516
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,480
Weighing as much as a full-grown gorilla,

517
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,600
a sperm whale only needs to hunt 5

518
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,220
of these giants a day.

519
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,780
This is actually

520
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,840
the

521
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,360
most common

522
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,800
species that sperm whales eat in terms of

523
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,060
weight. This is actually

524
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,400
staple food. This is number 1 thing in

525
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,400
their diet. But they've hardly ever been seen.

526
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,280
I'm actually pretty sure this is the first

527
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,840
footage we have of day-not-to-be-squid

528
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,980
in the Atlantic.

529
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,220
This is amazing.

530
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,600
Thanks to the deep water team, we've seen

531
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,300
squid down there

532
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,700
large enough

533
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,100
to feed this huge population of sperm whales.

534
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,400
But what's fueling this rich ecosystem?

535
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,320
It's all down to the tiniest organisms in

536
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,960
the ocean.

537
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,920
When deep ocean currents hit the island's underwater

538
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,420
slopes,

539
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,720
nutrient-rich water is forced up toward the surface.

540
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,680
These nutrients feed microorganisms

541
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,240
that form the base of the food web.

542
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,180
And the more there are, the more life

543
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,900
this ecosystem can support.

544
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,540
To find out just how rich these waters

545
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,040
are,

546
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,700
Edie and Zolekka once again take a dive

547
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,540
into the deep.

548
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,640
The density of this microscopic

549
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,180
life is difficult to judge in these dark

550
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,680
waters.

551
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,660
But Edie has a magic trick to reveal

552
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,640
it. MUSIC PLAYS

553
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,660
600 metres.

554
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,960
Oh, I hope this works.

555
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,600
OK, you ready?

556
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,120
321,

557
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,560
lights coming on.

558
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,340
Nothing.

559
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,240
Let's drop down.

560
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,500
Control Neptune,

561
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,920
we are ascending. Okay, let's try

562
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,840
it again.

563
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,160
Okay,

564
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,800
let's try it again.

565
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,080
Okay, 321, lights coming

566
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:32,920
on.

567
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:36,760
Oh!

568
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,560
Whoo!

569
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,640
It worked!

570
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,940
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

571
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,760
Wow!

572
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,980
Bioluminescence in action. Fire, luminescence in action.

573
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,680
It's like I'm wrapped in a blanket of

574
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,180
stars.

575
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
This is the base of the full chain.

576
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,620
The fish eat the plankton

577
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,560
and the squid eat the fish.

578
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,720
And then the sperm whales are fitting on

579
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,300
the squid,

580
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,040
this is where it all begins.

581
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,540
Smallest

582
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,900
to the biggest.

583
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,480
That's

584
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,020
fantastic. Edie's witnessed this bioluminescent

585
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,540
phenomenon her entire career,

586
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,720
but has never had the technology to share

587
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,680
it with the world...

588
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,020
Until now.

589
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,420
Wow, thanks, Edie. You got it.

590
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,460
It's like having seen UFOs,

591
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,680
and now suddenly there's evidence.

592
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,920
OK, can we do that again?

593
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,020
Absolutely.

594
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,180
Without this abundance of tiny life,

595
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,600
the squid and the sperm whales couldn't survive

596
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,140
here. It's very, very humbling to think that

597
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,360
no matter how tiny you are, you can

598
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,660
do gigantic

599
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,520
things.

600
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,135
Control control net tunes ascending. Over. Gigantic things.

601
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:29,180
Control, control, Neptune's ascending, over.

602
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,540
Clear the surface, clear the surface. Welcome back,

603
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,040
Neptune.

604
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,380
Blow your tanks.

605
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,960
Where did you enjoy that dive? Oh, are

606
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,640
you kidding?

607
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,940
That was actually on my bucket list.

608
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,580
You know, as I get older, every expedition

609
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,160
I go on, I figure this might be

610
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,860
the last.

611
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:55,970
And

612
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,660
if this is the last, it's the best.

613
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,260
It's just been absolutely amazing. Absolutely amazing.

614
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,020
In their time here in the

615
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,920
Azores, the team has captured the first ever

616
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,600
images of a sperm whale diving into these

617
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,400
deep waters.

618
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,060
This is the culmination of a huge amount

619
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,200
of effort and many sleepless nights. But At

620
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,760
the end of the day, we got those

621
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,300
few minutes of incredibly

622
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,660
priceless footage

623
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,120
that made the whole thing worth it.

624
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,580
It was awesome.

625
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,060
They've added to the image catalog of the

626
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,780
squid that feed the sperm whales.

627
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,600
Thanks to the Ocean Explorer, we've been able

628
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,200
to dive deep into the world of sperm

629
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,580
whales here and discovered this interaction between them

630
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,920
and massive squid that's never really been observed

631
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,100
here before, which is pretty mind-blowing.

632
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,960
And they've documented the normally invisible riches

633
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
that fuel this entire ecosystem.

634
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:14,940
It's

635
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,940
fabulous. I am 1 of the few

636
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,740
people to witness a bi-luminescence

637
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,560
light show. And I'm so excited to share

638
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,500
this with the world.

639
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,660
That is mind blowing.

640
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,800
We've still got so much to learn about

641
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,360
these whales, but seeing them live in harmony,

642
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,600
they could definitely teach us a thing or

643
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,840
2. No!

644
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,740
From the largest...

645
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,960
...To the tiniest creatures.

646
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,560
The team has made significant discoveries here in

647
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,200
the Azores.

648
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,400
Nothing like that has ever been filmed.

649
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,780
A rich hot spot for life in the

650
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,280
Atlantic,

651
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,040
and a blueprint for healthy oceans

652
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,020
everywhere.

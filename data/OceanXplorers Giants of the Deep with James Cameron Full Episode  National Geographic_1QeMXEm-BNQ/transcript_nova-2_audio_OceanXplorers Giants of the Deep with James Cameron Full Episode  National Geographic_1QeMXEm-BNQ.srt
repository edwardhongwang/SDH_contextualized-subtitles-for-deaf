1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,420
The ocean,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,220
the last frontier on earth,

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,300
so much is unexplored

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,740
and unexplained.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,980
To change that,

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,260
a kickass team of insanely talented specialists

7
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,575
is setting out to push the frontiers

8
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:19,535
of what we know about our oceans.

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,335
Oh my god.

10
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:23,695
Zoelleke Philander,

11
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,375
deep sea scientist.

12
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:28,955
Being a deep sea researcher means having front

13
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:29,610
row tickets

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,570
to the best movie that everybody wants to

15
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,070
watch.

16
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,370
Melissa Marquez Straight ahead, 12 o'clock. Shark biologist

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,090
We just saw what no one has seen

18
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:40,590
before.

19
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,170
Eric Stackpole

20
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,055
Scan now. Ocean tech innovator I love building

21
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:48,295
tools that allow us to see things in

22
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:49,835
ways we've never seen before.

23
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,235
And Aldo Kane

24
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:54,235
This is absurd.

25
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:56,795
Former Royal Marine Special Ops.

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,440
It doesn't get any more cutting edge exploration

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,520
than this. Their secret weapon,

28
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,320
the Ocean Explorer,

29
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,280
the most technologically advanced research vessel ever built.

30
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:16,495
There's never been a more urgent need to

31
00:01:16,495 --> 00:01:17,795
understand our ocean

32
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,595
and the animals that call it home,

33
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:22,995
because their lives

34
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:24,275
and ours

35
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:25,830
depend on it.

36
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,610
Okay. Here we go. 2 o'clock. 2 o'clock.

37
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,170
This time, the team tracks sperm whales

38
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,390
down into an alien world

39
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,690
What is that?

40
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,930
Full of fantastical creatures.

41
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:52,045
The ocean explorer is heading for deep water,

42
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:56,525
just off the Azores.

43
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,930
A chain of tiny volcanic islands

44
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,850
in the middle of the Atlantic,

45
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,650
and a rich oasis

46
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,405
for an abundance of marine life.

47
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,710
Every summer, nearly a 1000 sperm whales gather

48
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,210
here.

49
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,770
They're easily identified by their distinctive sideways spout.

50
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:44,505
These whales spend most of their lives deep

51
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:45,485
below the surface.

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,710
But using the full scope of the Ocean

53
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,850
Explorer's tech,

54
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,310
the team hopes to shine a light on

55
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,050
their lives down in these black depths.

56
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,305
Stand by, 9 o'clock.

57
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,300
Sperm whales were hunted here as recently as

58
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,800
1987,

59
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,820
and they live up to 70 years, so

60
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,680
some of them may still remember that.

61
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,320
They're understandably

62
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,000
nervous around boats,

63
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,785
so Aldo and Melissa approach cautiously.

64
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,630
You got your eyes on them?

65
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,470
They're sneaky, I tell you.

66
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:57,515
Oh my god. They're right underneath us. They're

67
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:58,415
right underneath us.

68
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,215
Wow. Look at that.

69
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:11,055
It's a whole family pod.

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,440
That's gorgeous.

71
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,440
That is a first for me.

72
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,320
Yeah.

73
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:31,045
Sperm whales are the largest toothed predator on

74
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:31,705
the planet.

75
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:38,505
To study these giants up close and personal,

76
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,860
Aldo and Melissa join them beneath the waves.

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,665
Getting under the water and just seeing this

78
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:53,645
giant animal,

79
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,005
you can feel it

80
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:58,365
looking at you,

81
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:02,025
trying to figure out what the heck you

82
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:02,525
are.

83
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,620
But they won't have long.

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,160
Sperm whales spend just 20% of their lives

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,900
at the surface.

86
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:26,685
When they dive, it's phenomenal.

87
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:33,330
One swoosh of their tail and they are

88
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,470
gone.

89
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,410
These whales are diving a mile deep for

90
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,030
up to an hour at a time.

91
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:50,165
The buoyancy of their huge lungs and the

92
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:52,905
thick blubber should make that almost impossible.

93
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,925
But not only do they manage it, they

94
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:56,985
make it look effortless.

95
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,780
But exactly how they dive so deep has

96
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,840
never been filmed.

97
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,480
If the team can get a camera

98
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:18,365
on a whale, it could further their understanding.

99
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:24,125
They recruit the help of Rui Prieto,

100
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,345
a world leading whale biologist. He's been studying

101
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:30,720
them in the Azores for over 20 years.

102
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,220
We want to see

103
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,140
what they are actually doing,

104
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,060
while they are underwater.

105
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
Eric sets to work helping Rui build a

106
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,665
camera tag that can withstand the immense pressure

107
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:47,205
of a sperm whale dive.

108
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:50,885
Okay. So this is the power system,

109
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:51,925
and then

110
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:54,065
we've just got the little camera. You know,

111
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:55,745
the whole thing looks pretty simple, but I

112
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:57,105
mean, the thing that keeps going through my

113
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:59,250
mind is, you know, we're gonna have maybe

114
00:06:59,250 --> 00:06:59,990
one window

115
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,290
and one chance of putting this together the

116
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,030
right way.

117
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,730
So do you think that's, something we can

118
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,810
do? Fingers crossed. Right? I guess we'll find

119
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,310
out.

120
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,970
If they can pull this off, they'll get

121
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,895
the first ever footage of a deep sperm

122
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,195
whale dive in the Azores.

123
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:21,875
Yeah.

124
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:25,715
Let's turn a whale into a cameraman.

125
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,020
You have a green light. Copy green light.

126
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,080
Detect. We're off.

127
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,280
We need to start looking for blows.

128
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,240
Yeah.

129
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,025
Oh, looks like there could be something over

130
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:49,525
there.

131
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,485
4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

132
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:55,685
9, 10. I count 11 whales here.

133
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:57,685
All in a tight cluster.

134
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,320
Okay. Here we go. 2 o'clock. 2 o'clock.

135
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,920
You should have a pretty good eye at

136
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,380
3 100, 400 meters.

137
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,060
Breaching.

138
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,820
No.

139
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:16,765
We think breaching might be a form of

140
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:19,805
communication between a sperm whale family. However, sometimes

141
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:22,045
it might just be the teenagers fooling around

142
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,905
and, you know, blowing off some steam.

143
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,040
Let's go there very slowly.

144
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,320
Slow and steady wins the race.

145
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,500
Is that speed okay? Need to gain a

146
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,340
little bit on them because they are almost

147
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,840
diving.

148
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,705
When you're piloting a boat this close to

149
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:42,405
Wales, there's absolutely

150
00:08:42,945 --> 00:08:44,085
no room for error.

151
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,625
You're dealing with a live animal, so the

152
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,405
whole thing has to be

153
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:51,845
110% perfect or it's an aborted mission.

154
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,810
That's it.

155
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,650
Well done. Well done, dude. Tag on.

156
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,755
Ocean Explorer, this is Eagle Ray over. Eagle

157
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,455
Ray, Ocean Explorer. Go ahead.

158
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:15,595
Tag deployed and we will mark location on

159
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:16,255
the GPS.

160
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,095
Copy that. Nice work.

161
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,730
The tag is designed to release after 8

162
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,890
hours and send a signal to help the

163
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,950
team locate it,

164
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,990
somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic.

165
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,085
It is an intense feeling to spend all

166
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:38,405
this time on something and then watch it

167
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,405
just go into the abyss on the back

168
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:41,065
of a whale.

169
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:48,900
What's this direction in front

170
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:50,073
of

171
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:51,247
us?

172
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,500
Confirm you have visual on the tag.

173
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,280
Affirmative. We're looking at something orange in the

174
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,660
water. It could be the tag.

175
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,255
Roger that. We are making our way to

176
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:03,715
your location now, Olga.

177
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:07,075
I see it.

178
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:08,995
We have visual on the tag.

179
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,495
A little bit more, Elga. Yeah. There you

180
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:15,750
go. Right there.

181
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,470
You got it? Yep. I have it. I'm

182
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,750
dying to know, how does the tag look?

183
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,370
The tag does look in good condition, and

184
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,550
the camera looks like it is still dry.

185
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,510
Yes.

186
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,805
Alright. Great job, guys.

187
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:40,605
Should I cut this? Yes, please.

188
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:43,945
Now it could be some water inside, so

189
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,165
we need to be careful.

190
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,120
Very slowly.

191
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,480
Very carefully.

192
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,020
I'm, like, excited and nervous at the same

193
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,340
time. You know? Like, did everything work properly?

194
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,600
Did the batteries last? Yes. Yes.

195
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,680
Got it? Take it off.

196
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:01,645
It's dry. Okay. And then there's our SD

197
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:04,065
card. You got it? I'm I got it.

198
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,025
This is it.

199
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,125
This is what we've been working all this

200
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,685
time for. Let's plug this to the computer

201
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:12,385
and see. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

202
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,330
Anything

203
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,090
that comes off this thing is new.

204
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,410
Oh, my god.

205
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,345
That's the the blowhole,

206
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:34,605
and it's going down because it's it's getting

207
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:35,105
darker.

208
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,945
As they dive, sperm whales undergo an incredible

209
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:39,585
transformation.

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,580
The pressure of the water compresses their lungs,

211
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,500
and with less volume inside,

212
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,260
they become less buoyant,

213
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,020
allowing them to dive faster with minimum effort.

214
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,865
As she dives faster, the force of the

215
00:11:57,865 --> 00:11:59,645
water pushes the camera sideways.

216
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:03,325
At 450

217
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:04,205
feet,

218
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:05,485
it flips.

219
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,660
It's pointing backwards? Yeah. It's pointing backwards.

220
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,780
We can actually see

221
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,540
the flukes beating.

222
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,815
Eric and Rui are the first people ever

223
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:22,295
to see a sperm whale use its body

224
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:23,275
and tail flukes

225
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:25,035
to dive into the deep.

226
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:29,275
I'm learning a lot about how they actually

227
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:33,035
flex the their their flukes. It's very slow.

228
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:33,920
It's very

229
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,200
calm.

230
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,520
Then at 900 feet, the whales' behavior changes.

231
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,395
Look. The tail stopped moving. Yeah. It's it's

232
00:12:47,395 --> 00:12:50,935
called gliding. They use the the the momentum

233
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,715
that they have to glide and keep energy.

234
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,575
I see. And I I've never seen it.

235
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:58,135
So it it it's just amazing.

236
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,060
Its tail may have stopped moving, but this

237
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,360
whale is still diving.

238
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,620
With gravity doing the work, it can save

239
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,120
energy and preserve precious oxygen.

240
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:17,935
Listen.

241
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:22,335
It's hunting. This is the hunting sound. Yeah.

242
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,955
Sperm whales use sound to hunt in the

243
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:27,455
dark.

244
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,090
When their sonar clicks hit an object and

245
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:33,990
bounce back,

246
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,770
the whale can locate a target over a

247
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,510
mile away.

248
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,265
It's getting lighter in the background. Who knows

249
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:50,605
that? Yeah. The the water is becoming clearer.

250
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:54,025
No luck this time, so the whale begins

251
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,725
its journey back to the surface.

252
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,740
I hear a different a slightly higher pitched

253
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,280
clicking. It was a coda.

254
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,260
It's communicating with its family just like Morse

255
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,160
code for whales.

256
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,805
Another one. Someone is answering.

257
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:21,965
Each family unit has a unique coda

258
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:23,865
that can be heard from up to 2

259
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:24,685
miles away.

260
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,445
Well, 2, 2, 2. Another one.

261
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,060
This is how a surfacing whale reconnects with

262
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,800
its family.

263
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,620
So you hear the codas, and then the

264
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,540
other one comes. Yeah. Yeah. Do we know

265
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,520
that they do this?

266
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,815
Know that they talk to each other using

267
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:48,795
codas, but I've never seen them come together.

268
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,510
Oh, I can't believe we got this off.

269
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,830
They are completely interacting.

270
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:17,015
Nothing like that has ever been filmed.

271
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,015
It's just amazing.

272
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,130
We are seeing something that has never been

273
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,950
seen before.

274
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,970
These huge whales going to a part of

275
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,045
the world that we know almost nothing about,

276
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,125
and we get a first person view. I'm

277
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,205
right next to Rui, and he spent his

278
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:44,105
entire life

279
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,245
trying to understand these animals, and this is

280
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,865
something he's never seen before.

281
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:12,305
Once back at the surface, some sperm whales

282
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,605
spend their time socializing.

283
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:21,970
Reestablishing

284
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,410
family bonds.

285
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:38,915
Others

286
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,075
grab a quick power nap.

287
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,730
But their time together is brief.

288
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,315
After just 15 minutes, they'll dive again

289
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,995
in their never ending pursuit of prey.

290
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,190
Sperm whales eat up to a ton of

291
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,410
squid a day.

292
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,530
And with nearly a 1000 sperm whales here,

293
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:27,335
that's a lot of squid.

294
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:32,595
So what kind of squid are hiding down

295
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:34,755
there in the depths that could satisfy such

296
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:35,895
voracious appetites

297
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:38,720
to find out the team need to get

298
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,700
down there themselves.

299
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,700
The mission will be led by Zulekha,

300
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,475
the ocean explorer's deep sea researcher.

301
00:18:00,535 --> 00:18:03,675
For this mission, I'm partnering with Edi Wouda,

302
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,100
one of the world's most experienced deep sea

303
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,600
biologists.

304
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,480
You ready to dive?

305
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,760
Yes.

306
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,415
So Neptune, we are ready to

307
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:22,455
to show touches. SO bridge, you are clear

308
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:23,595
to roll sub out.

309
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:29,755
Eighty's been pushing the envelope in ocean exploration

310
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:31,760
for over 40 years.

311
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,400
That's Neptune in the border.

312
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,800
Venting now.

313
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:52,335
Depth, 2 0 meters. Vent secured. Descending. Over.

314
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,240
Every time we dive into the deep, we

315
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,620
are heading into the unknown.

316
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,660
We are explorers,

317
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,820
and this is our spaceship.

318
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:15,225
600 feet down, the team enters the twilight

319
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:15,725
zone.

320
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,100
A world dominated by darkness

321
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,500
and alien creatures.

322
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,975
Oh, look at that. Look at that.

323
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,615
What are you seeing?

324
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:43,135
It's a glass squid,

325
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:45,455
a rare sighting.

326
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,180
Being transparent,

327
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,500
that's a defense mechanism.

328
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:06,825
Such an amazing adaptation.

329
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:09,845
You see it a lot in the ocean,

330
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:11,545
but you don't see it much on land.

331
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,240
At 1500 feet, they find even more signs

332
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,900
of life.

333
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,640
What is that? 21. 1. Look. Just turn

334
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,720
to the right. Turn to the right. It's

335
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,475
ink, but it's so much. Oh my god.

336
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:37,935
Oh, yeah. That's a massive pool of ink.

337
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:41,215
Where's the squid though?

338
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:43,615
Oh, squid. Squid.

339
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:46,335
A bird squid.

340
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,630
Hello. I know. And this one has attitude.

341
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,090
Oh, my gosh. It's squid. Beautiful. Oh, look

342
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,750
at these.

343
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:53,710
I

344
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,710
think he's trying to eat saleka. Yeah.

345
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,665
It's good food.

346
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:14,640
As the sub dives to 25 100 feet,

347
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,300
Salehka spots something extraordinary.

348
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,940
Oh, my word.

349
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,580
Is that a whiplash squid?

350
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,100
Look how exquisite

351
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:33,725
it is. All squid can change color by

352
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,225
expanding or contracting cells in their skin

353
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:37,425
called chromatophores.

354
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:43,780
Do you think do you think it's signaling

355
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,700
to other squid?

356
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,780
No.

357
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,860
Is this an alarm signal?

358
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,700
How does one even decode

359
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,700
what we're really seeing here?

360
00:22:02,895 --> 00:22:04,495
I'd like to think I'm a level headed

361
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:04,995
scientist,

362
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,675
but wow.

363
00:22:07,455 --> 00:22:08,595
When you come across

364
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:11,395
an encounter like this,

365
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:13,500
it's absolutely stunning.

366
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,100
Absolutely stunning.

367
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,100
This is why we do it, Eddy.

368
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,040
Sperm whales do prey on whiplash squid, but

369
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,620
they're so small, they'd need to eat 1,000

370
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,580
every day.

371
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:36,815
At 33 100 feet, they approach the boundary

372
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,255
of the midnight zone.

373
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,700
The midnight zone is pitch black, and it's

374
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,200
freezing.

375
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,700
But as hostile as this place is, this

376
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,040
is where the sperm whale finds its food.

377
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,780
So it's important that we go take a

378
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,760
look down there.

379
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:59,095
But the sub reaches its maximum dive

380
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:01,575
depth. It can't go any farther.

381
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:10,855
Control. Control.

382
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,570
Neptune passing 50 meters, clear to surface.

383
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:27,925
If they want to search the midnight zone

384
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:29,865
for larger sperm whale prey,

385
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:32,645
the team will have to mobilize the ship's

386
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:33,145
ROV,

387
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:36,025
a remotely operated vehicle.

388
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,450
The ROV is capable of going to depths

389
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,810
of 20,000 feet. So getting to 5,000 feet

390
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,570
where the sperm whales are going should be

391
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,710
no problem at all.

392
00:23:56,825 --> 00:24:00,105
Melissa baits the ROV with deepwater squid's favorite

393
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:00,605
meal,

394
00:24:01,865 --> 00:24:02,685
other squid.

395
00:24:03,065 --> 00:24:05,485
And that is a squid ready to be

396
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:06,205
lifelike

397
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,580
in the water

398
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,420
column.

399
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:28,105
Through its tether to the ship, the ROV

400
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:29,625
sends back a live picture.

401
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,650
Exploring the deep, you often see something that

402
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,810
you have never seen before, but you hope

403
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,490
that you're gonna see something no one has

404
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,230
seen before.

405
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:49,655
Lights off.

406
00:24:57,795 --> 00:24:59,095
Oh, incoming incoming.

407
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:00,295
Here we go.

408
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:03,980
Woah. What what is that?

409
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,580
Bingo.

410
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,020
Kitefin shark.

411
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,720
The squid lure has drawn in more than

412
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,020
the team bargained for.

413
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:19,535
He looks like a good size.

414
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:23,135
These guys can get up to, like, £30

415
00:25:23,195 --> 00:25:23,855
on average.

416
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:27,595
Sperm whales, yeah, they do eat them, but

417
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:29,455
actually have a preference for squid.

418
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,360
After hours in the deep and just one

419
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,980
encounter with the kite fin,

420
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,160
the team wonders if the noise from the

421
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,500
ROV could be scaring off the squid.

422
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,985
Time to try a different approach.

423
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:57,705
Marine biologist Nathan Robinson

424
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,200
has the perfect camera rig for this mission.

425
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,000
The angler is a stealth camera, makes

426
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,960
no noise. It's also very

427
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,060
light sensitive, so this actually really is perfect

428
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,145
for seeing animals in

429
00:26:15,445 --> 00:26:16,345
the deep sea.

430
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,860
Going down.

431
00:26:39,795 --> 00:26:40,775
Hey, keep letting

432
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:42,535
it

433
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:46,755
go. Lowering the angler on a fishing line

434
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:49,155
may look low tech, but this is our

435
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:50,135
secret weapon.

436
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:54,560
It can dive to 6 1,500

437
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,680
feet

438
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,600
and then just sit there

439
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,000
completely silent and still

440
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,640
so as not to scare away any wildlife.

441
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:10,295
The angler is armed with an e jelly,

442
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:14,215
an LED array that mimics the defense mechanism

443
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:15,975
of the Atolla jellyfish,

444
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:19,155
which lights up when threatened to try and

445
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:21,555
attract an even larger predator in the hope

446
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:23,255
that it will scare off the attacker.

447
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,020
After hours in the deep, the rig is

448
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,160
ready to be retrieved.

449
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,315
Only once back aboard will the team discover

450
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:42,655
if their covert mission has been a success.

451
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:51,755
Alright. You ready to bring it to the

452
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:52,710
lab? Yeah.

453
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,270
Okay. So now we're going down to the

454
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,770
bottom.

455
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,275
Oh, my god. What a catch.

456
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:18,870
These flying squid are known sperm whale prey.

457
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,390
We've been seeing a ton of squid conducting

458
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,630
these hit and run attacks on the baits

459
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,610
and the e jelly.

460
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,895
They are large,

461
00:28:37,195 --> 00:28:38,095
very nutritious

462
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:41,295
food items for something like a sperm whale.

463
00:28:45,915 --> 00:28:48,620
Hours into the footage, Nathan and Eric spot

464
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,760
something even larger,

465
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,640
and they gather the rest of the team.

466
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,080
Just watch this.

467
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,985
What? That is a really big squid. So

468
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:05,385
this species is the 3rd largest in the

469
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:05,885
oceans.

470
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:09,325
Dana octopus squid is the the common name.

471
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:11,225
It's got light organs on the ends of

472
00:29:11,225 --> 00:29:12,985
its arms that are like the size of

473
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,945
lemons. Look at them. They're glowing so bright.

474
00:29:15,945 --> 00:29:18,470
Why would you have such bright lights there?

475
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,550
To blind you. Oh, it's like a deer

476
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,630
in the headlights. Yeah. So you've got your

477
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,310
little critter, your little crustacean that you wanna

478
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,770
eat. You shine these big, kinda lemon sized

479
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,925
lights right at it. It can't see what's

480
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:32,005
coming from what direction, and then, bam, you

481
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:32,825
take it down.

482
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:37,385
Weighing as much as a full grown gorilla,

483
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:40,485
a sperm whale only needs to hunt 5

484
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:42,105
of these giants a day.

485
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:43,625
This is actually

486
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:44,665
the

487
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:46,460
most common,

488
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,720
species that sperm whales eat in terms of

489
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,020
weight. This is actually

490
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
simple food. This is number 1, in their

491
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,640
diet. They're eating. Yeah. But they've hardly ever

492
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,735
been seen. I'm actually pretty sure this is

493
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:59,975
the first footage we have of Dane octopus

494
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:02,235
squid in the Atlantic. This is amazing.

495
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:08,135
Thanks to the Deepwater team, we've seen squid

496
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:09,595
down there large enough

497
00:30:10,215 --> 00:30:13,035
to feed this huge population of sperm whales.

498
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,450
But what's fueling this rich ecosystem?

499
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,270
It's all down to the tiniest organisms in

500
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:27,930
the ocean.

501
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:32,825
When deep ocean currents hit the island's underwater

502
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:33,385
slopes,

503
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,165
nutrient rich water is forced up toward the

504
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:36,665
surface.

505
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,625
These nutrients feed microorganisms

506
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,180
form the base of the food web.

507
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,160
And the more there are, the more life

508
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,860
this ecosystem can support.

509
00:30:57,175 --> 00:30:59,415
To find out just how rich these waters

510
00:30:59,415 --> 00:30:59,915
are,

511
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,615
Idi and Zuleka once again take a dive

512
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:03,595
into the deep.

513
00:31:19,915 --> 00:31:22,875
The density of this microscopic life is difficult

514
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,655
to judge in these dark waters,

515
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,595
but Eddy has a magic trick to reveal

516
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:30,095
it.

517
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,570
600 meters.

518
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:49,935
Oh, I hope this works.

519
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:52,575
Okay. You ready?

520
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:53,695
Okay.

521
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:56,575
3, 2, 1. Lights coming on.

522
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,270
Nothing.

523
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:10,655
Let's drop down.

524
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:14,015
Control that tune, we are descending.

525
00:32:22,635 --> 00:32:23,135
Okay.

526
00:32:23,435 --> 00:32:24,735
Let's try it again.

527
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,020
Okay. 321. Lights coming

528
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,900
on.

529
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,700
Woo.

530
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,620
It worked.

531
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:42,865
Wow.

532
00:32:49,725 --> 00:32:50,865
Bio luminescence

533
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:51,985
in action.

534
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,670
It's like I'm wrapped in a blanket of

535
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,170
stars.

536
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,065
This is the base of the food chain.

537
00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:11,585
The fish eat the plankton,

538
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:15,085
and the squid eat the fish. And then

539
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:17,185
the sperm whales are feeding on the squid.

540
00:33:18,445 --> 00:33:19,745
This is where it all begins,

541
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:21,105
smallest

542
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,730
to the biggest.

543
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,850
That's fantastic.

544
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,610
Edie's witnessed this bioluminescent

545
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,505
phenomenon her entire career,

546
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,760
It's like having seen UFOs, and now suddenly

547
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,580
there's evidence.

548
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,740
Okay. Can we do that again?

549
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,860
Absolutely.

550
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,100
Without this abundance of tiny life,

551
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,475
the squid and the sperm whales couldn't survive

552
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:12,015
here. It's very, very humbling to think that

553
00:34:12,235 --> 00:34:14,255
no matter how tiny you are, you can't

554
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:14,815
do

555
00:34:15,195 --> 00:34:16,415
gigantic things.

556
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,180
Control, control, Neptune's ascending over.

557
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,295
Clear the surface. Clear the surface. Welcome back,

558
00:34:32,535 --> 00:34:33,035
Neptune.

559
00:34:33,495 --> 00:34:34,475
Blow your tanks.

560
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,895
Oh, did you enjoy that day? Oh, are

561
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:42,455
you kidding? That was actually on my bucket

562
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:42,955
list.

563
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,570
You know, as I get older, every expedition

564
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,150
I go on, I figure this might be

565
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,810
the last.

566
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,150
And if this is the last, it's the

567
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,650
best.

568
00:34:58,955 --> 00:35:01,215
It's just been absolutely amazing.

569
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:12,015
In their time here in the Azores,

570
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,220
the team has captured the first ever images

571
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,860
of a sperm whale diving into these deep

572
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,360
waters.

573
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,980
This is the culmination of a huge amount

574
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,125
of effort and many sleepless nights, but at

575
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,805
the end of the day, we got those

576
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:34,625
few minutes of incredibly priceless footage

577
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:37,105
that made the whole thing worth it.

578
00:35:37,725 --> 00:35:38,545
It was awesome.

579
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,890
They've added to the image catalog of the

580
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,670
squid that feed the sperm whales.

581
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,530
Thanks to the Ocean Explorer, we've been able

582
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,245
to dive deep into the world of sperm

583
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:56,545
whales here and discovered this interaction between them

584
00:35:56,765 --> 00:35:59,885
and massive squid that's never really been observed

585
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:02,305
here before, which is pretty mind blowing.

586
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,890
And they've documented the normally invisible riches

587
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,370
that fuel this entire ecosystem.

588
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,210
It's fabulous.

589
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,230
I am one of the few people to

590
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,530
witness a bioluminescence

591
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:21,115
light

592
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:23,575
show, and I'm so excited to share this

593
00:36:23,575 --> 00:36:24,395
with the world.

594
00:36:27,575 --> 00:36:28,795
That is mind blowing.

595
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,720
We've still got so much to learn about

596
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,335
these whales, but seeing them live in harmony,

597
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:47,555
they could definitely teach us a thing or

598
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:48,055
2.

599
00:36:48,435 --> 00:36:48,935
No.

600
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:51,655
From the largest

601
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:56,935
to the tiniest creatures,

602
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,560
the team has made significant discoveries here in

603
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,220
the Azores.

604
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,380
Nothing like that has ever been filmed.

605
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,260
A rich hotspot for life in the Atlantic,

606
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,985
and a blueprint for healthy oceans

607
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:15,105
everywhere.

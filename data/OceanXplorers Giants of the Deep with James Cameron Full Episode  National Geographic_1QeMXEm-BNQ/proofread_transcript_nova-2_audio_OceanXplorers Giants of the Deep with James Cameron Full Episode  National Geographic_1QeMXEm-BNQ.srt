**Corrected Transcript:**

1  
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,420  
The ocean,

2  
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,220  
the last frontier on Earth,

3  
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,300  
so much is unexplored

4  
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,740  
and unexplained.

5  
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,980  
To change that,

6  
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,260  
an exceptional team of incredibly talented specialists

7  
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,575  
is setting out to push the frontiers

8  
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:19,535  
of what we know about our oceans.

9  
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,335  
Oh my God.

10  
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:23,695  
Zoleka Filander,

11  
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,375  
deep-sea scientist.

12  
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:29,955  
Being a deep-sea researcher means having front-row tickets

13  
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,570  
to the best movie that everybody wants to watch.

14  
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,010  
Melissa MÃ¡rquez,

15  
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,010  
shark biologist.

16  
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,090  
"Straight ahead, 12 o'clock."

17  
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,090  
"We just saw what no one has seen before."

18  
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:41,790  
Eric Stackpole,

19  
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,570  
ocean tech innovator.

20  
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,570  
"Scan now."

21  
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,295  
"I love building tools that allow us to see things in ways we've never seen before."

22  
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,235  
And Aldo Kane.

23  
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:54,235  
"This is absurd."

24  
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:56,795  
Former Royal Marine Special Ops.

25  
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,440  
"It doesn't get any more cutting-edge exploration than this."

26  
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,520  
Their secret weapon:

27  
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,320  
the Ocean Explorer,

28  
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,280  
the most technologically advanced research vessel ever built.

29  
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:16,495  
There's never been a more urgent need

30  
00:01:16,495 --> 00:01:17,795  
to understand our ocean

31  
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,595  
and the animals that call it home,

32  
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:22,995  
because their lives

33  
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:24,275  
and ours

34  
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:25,830  
depend on it.

35  
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,610  
"Okay, here we go. Two o'clock, two o'clock."

36  
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,170  
This time, the team tracks sperm whales

37  
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,390  
down into an alien world

38  
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,690  
"What is that?"

39  
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,930  
full of fantastical creatures.

40  
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:52,045  
The Ocean Explorer is heading for deep water,

41  
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:56,525  
just off the Azores,

42  
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,930  
a chain of tiny volcanic islands

43  
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,850  
in the middle of the Atlantic,

44  
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,650  
and a rich oasis

45  
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,405  
for an abundance of marine life.

46  
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,710  
Every summer, nearly 1,000 sperm whales gather here.

47  
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,770  
They're easily identified by their distinctive sideways spout.

48  
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:44,505  
These whales spend most of their lives

49  
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:45,485  
deep below the surface.

50  
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,710  
But using the full scope of the Ocean

51  
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,850  
Explorer's tech,

52  
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,310  
the team hopes to shine a light on

53  
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,050  
their lives down in these black depths.

54  
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,305  
"Stand by, nine o'clock."

55  
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,300  
Sperm whales were hunted here as recently as

56  
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,800  
1987,

57  
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,820  
and they live up to 70 years,

58  
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,680  
so some of them may still remember that.

59  
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,320  
They're understandably

60  
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,000  
nervous around boats,

61  
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,785  
so Aldo and Melissa approach cautiously.

62  
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,630  
"You got your eyes on them?"

63  
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,470  
"They're sneaky, I tell you."

64  
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:57,515  
"Oh my God, they're right underneath us!

65  
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:58,415  
Right underneath us!"

66  
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,075  
"Wow, look at that!"

67  
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:11,055  
It's a whole family pod.

68  
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,440  
"That's gorgeous."

69  
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,440  
"That is a first for me."

70  
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,320  
"Yeah."

71  
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:31,045  
Sperm whales are the largest toothed predators on

72  
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:31,705  
the planet.

73  
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:38,505  
To study these giants up close and personal,

74  
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,860  
Aldo and Melissa join them beneath the waves.

75  
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,665  
Getting under the water and just seeing this

76  
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:53,645  
giant animal,

77  
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,005  
you can feel it

78  
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:58,365  
looking at you,

79  
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:02,025  
trying to figure out what the heck you

80  
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:02,525  
are.

81  
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,620  
But they won't have long.

82  
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,160  
Sperm whales spend just 20% of their lives

83  
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,900  
at the surface.

84  
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:26,685  
"When they dive, it's phenomenal."

85  
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:33,330  
"One swoosh of their tail and they are

86  
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,470  
gone."

87  
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,410  
These whales are diving a mile deep for

88  
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,030  
up to an hour at a time.

89  
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:50,165  
The buoyancy of their huge lungs and their

90  
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:52,905  
thick blubber should make that almost impossible.

91  
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,925  
But not only do they manage it, they

92  
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:56,985  
make it look effortless.

93  
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,780  
But exactly how they dive so deep has

94  
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,840  
never been filmed.

95  
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,480  
If the team can get a camera

96  
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:18,365  
on a whale, it could further their understanding.

97  
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:24,125  
They recruit the help of Rui Prieto,

98  
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,345  
a world-leading whale biologist. He's been studying

99  
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:30,720  
them in the Azores for over 20 years.

100  
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,220  
"We want to see

101  
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,140  
what they are actually doing

102  
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,060  
while they are underwater."

103  
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720  
Eric sets to work helping Rui build a

104  
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,665  
camera tag that can withstand the immense pressure

105  
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:47,205  
of a sperm whale dive.

106  
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:50,885  
"Okay, so this is the power system,

107  
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:51,925  
and then

108  
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:54,065  
we've just got the little camera. You know,

109  
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:55,745  
the whole thing looks pretty simple, but I

110  
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:57,105  
mean, the thing that keeps going through my

111  
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:59,250  
mind is, you know, we're gonna have maybe

112  
00:06:59,250 --> 00:06:59,990  
one window

113  
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,290  
and one chance of putting this together the

114  
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,030  
right way."

115  
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,730  
"So do you think that's something we can

116  
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,810  
do?" "Fingers crossed, right? I guess we'll find

117  
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,310  
out."

118  
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,970  
If they can pull this off, they'll get

119  
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,895  
the first-ever footage of a deep sperm whale

120  
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,195  
dive in the Azores.

121  
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:21,875  
"Yeah.

122  
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:25,715  
Let's turn a whale into a cameraman!"

123  
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,020  
"You have a green light." "Copy, green light.

124  
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,080  
Detach. We're off."

125  
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,280  
"We need to start looking for blows."

126  
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,240  
"Yeah."

127  
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,025  
"Oh, looks like there could be something over

128  
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:49,525  
there."

129  
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,485  
"Four, five, six, seven, eight,

130  
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:55,685  
nine, ten. I count eleven whales here.

131  
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:57,685  
All in a tight cluster."

132  
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,320  
"Okay, here we go. Two o'clock, two o'clock.

133  
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,920  
You should have a pretty good eye at

134  
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,380  
three hundred, four hundred meters."

135  
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,060  
"Breaching."

136  
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,820  
"No."

137  
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:16,765  
"We think breaching might be a form of

138  
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:19,805  
communication between a sperm whale family. However, sometimes

139  
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:22,045  
it might just be the teenagers fooling around

140  
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,905  
and, you know, blowing off some steam."

141  
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,040  
"Let's go there very slowly."

142  
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,320  
"Slow and steady wins the race."

143  
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,500  
"Is that speed okay?" "Need to gain a

144  
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,340  
little bit on them because they are almost

145  
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,840  
diving."

146  
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,705  
When you're piloting a boat this close to

147  
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:42,405  
whales, there's absolutely

148  
00:08:42,945 --> 00:08:44,085  
no room for error.

149  
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,625  
You're dealing with a live animal, so the

150  
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,405  
whole thing has to be

151  
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:51,845  
110% perfect or it's an aborted mission.

152  
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,810  
"That's it."

153  
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,650  
"Well done. Well done. Tag on."

154  
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,755  
"Ocean Explorer, this is Eagle Ray, over." "Eagle

155  
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,455  
Ray, Ocean Explorer. Go ahead."

156  
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:15,595  
"Tag deployed, and we will mark location on

157  
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:16,255  
the GPS."

158  
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,095  
"Copy that. Nice work."

159  
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,730  
The tag is designed to release after eight

160  
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,890  
hours and send a signal to help the

161  
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,950  
team locate it,

162  
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,990  
somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic.

163  
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,085  
"It is an intense feeling to spend all

164  
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:38,405  
this time on something and then watch it

165  
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,405  
just go into the abyss on the back

166  
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:41,065  
of a whale."

167  
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:48,900  
"What's this direction in front

168  
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:50,073  
of

169  
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:51,247  
us?"

170  
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,500  
"Confirm you have visual on the tag."

171  
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,280  
"Affirmative. We're looking at something orange in the

172  
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,660  
water. It could be the tag."

173  
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,255  
"Roger that. We are making our way to

174  
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:03,715  
your location now, Olga."

175  
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:07,075  
"I see it."

176  
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:08,995  
"We have visual on the tag."

177  
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,495  
"A little bit more, Olga. Yeah. There you

178  
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:15,750  
go. Right there."

179  
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,470  
"You got it?" "Yep. I have it." "I'm

180  
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,750  
dying to know, how does the tag look?"

181  
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,370  
"The tag does look in good condition, and

182  
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,550  
the camera looks like it is still dry."

183  
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,510  
"Yes."

184  
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,805  
"Alright. Great job, guys."

185  
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:40,605  
"Should I cut this?" "Yes, please."

186  
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:43,945  
"Now, it could be some water inside, so

187  
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,165  
we need to be careful."

188  
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,120  
"Very slowly."

189  
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,480  
"Very carefully."

190  
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,020  
"I'm, like, excited and nervous at the same

191  
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,340  
time, you know? Like, did everything work properly?

192  
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,600  
Did the batteries last?" "Yes, yes."

193  
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,680  
"Got it? Take it off."

194  
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:01,645  
"It's dry." "Okay." "And then there's our SD

195  
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:04,065  
card." "You got it?" "I got it.

196  
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,025  
This is it."

197  
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,125  
"This is what we've been working all this

198  
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,685  
time for." "Let's plug this into the computer

199  
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:12,385  
and see." "Okay, yeah, okay."

200  
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,330  
"Anything?"

201  
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,090  
"Anything that comes off this thing is new."

202  
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,410  
"Oh my God."

203  
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,345  
"That's the blowhole,

204  
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:34,605  
and it's going down because it's getting darker."

205  
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,945  
As they dive, sperm whales undergo an incredible

206  
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:39,585  
transformation.

207  
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,580  
The pressure of the water compresses their lungs,

208  
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,500  
and with less volume inside,

209  
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,260  
they become less buoyant,

210  
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,020  
allowing them to dive faster with minimum effort.

211  
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,865  
"As she dives faster, the force of the

212  
00:11:57,865 --> 00:11:59,645  
water pushes the camera sideways."

213  
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:03,325  
"At 450

214  
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:04,205  
feet,

215  
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:05,485  
it flips."

216  
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,660  
"It's pointing backwards?" "Yeah, it's pointing backwards."

217  
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,780  
"We can actually see

218  
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,540  
the flukes beating."

219  
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,815  
Eric and Rui are the first people ever

220  
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:22,295  
to see a sperm whale use its body

221  
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:23,275  
and tail flukes

222  
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:25,035  
to dive into the deep.

223  
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:29,275  
"I'm learning a lot about how they actually

224  
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:33,035  
flex their flukes. It's very slow. It's very

225  
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:33,920  
calm."

226  
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,200  
Then, at 900

227  
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,520  
feet, the whale's behavior changes.

228  
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,395  
"Look, the tail stopped moving." "Yeah, it's

229  
00:12:47,395 --> 00:12:50,935  
called gliding. They use the momentum

230  
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,715  
that they have to glide and save energy."

231  
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,575  
"I see. I've never seen it.

232  
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:58,135  
It's just amazing."

233  
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,060  
Its tail may have stopped moving, but this

234  
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,360  
whale is still diving.

235  
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,620  
With gravity doing the work, it can save

236  
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,120  
energy and preserve precious oxygen.

237  
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:17,935  
"Listen."

238  
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:22,335  
"It's hunting. This is the hunting sound." "Yeah."

239  
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,955  
Sperm whales use sound to hunt in the

240  
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:27,455  
dark.

241  
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,090  
When their sonar clicks hit an object and

242  
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:33,990  
bounce back,

243  
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,770  
the whale can locate a target over a

244  
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,510  
mile away.

245  
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,265  
"It's getting lighter in the background. Who knows

246  
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:50,605  
that?" "Yeah, the water is becoming clearer."

247  
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:54,025  
No luck this time, so the whale begins

248  
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,725  
its journey back to the surface.

249  
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,740  
"I hear a different, a slightly higher-pitched

250  
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,280  
clicking." "It was a coda."

251  
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,260  
"It's communicating with its family, just like Morse

252  
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,160  
code for whales."

253  
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,805  
"Another one. Someone is answering."

254  
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:21,965  
Each family unit has a unique coda

255  
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:23,865  
that can be heard from up to two

256  
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:24,685  
miles away.

257  
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,445  
"Wow, two, two, two. Another one."

258  
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,060  
This is how a surfacing whale reconnects with

259  
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,800  
its family.

260  
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,620  
"So you hear the codas, and then the

261  
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,540  
other one comes." "Yeah." "Do we know

262  
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,520  
that they do this?"

263  
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,815  
"We know that they talk to each other using

264  
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:48,795  
codas, but I've never seen them come together."

265  
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,510  
"Oh, I can't believe we got this."

266  
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,830  
"They are completely interacting."

267  
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:17,015  
"Nothing like that has ever been filmed."

268  
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,015  
"It's just amazing."

269  
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,130  
"We are seeing something that has never been

270  
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,950  
seen before.

271  
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,970  
These huge whales going to a part of

272  
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,045  
the world that we know almost nothing about,

273  
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,125  
and we get a first-person view. I'm

274  
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,205  
right next to Rui, and he spent his

275  
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:44,105  
entire life

276  
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,245  
trying to understand these animals, and this is

277  
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,865  
something he's never seen before."

278  
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:12,305  
Once back at the surface, some sperm whales

279  
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,605  
spend their time socializing.

280  
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:21,970  
Reestablishing

281  
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,410  
family bonds.

282  
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:38,915  
Others

283  
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,075  
grab a quick power nap.

284  
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,730  
But their time together is brief.

285  
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,315  
After just 15 minutes, they'll dive again

286  
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,995  
in their never-ending pursuit of prey.

287  
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,190  
Sperm whales eat up to a ton of

288  
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,410  
squid a day.

289  
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,530  
And with nearly 1,000 sperm whales here,

290  
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:27,335  
that's a lot of squid.

291  
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:32,595  
So what kind of squid are hiding down

292  
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:34,755  
there in the depths that could satisfy such

293  
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:35,895  
voracious appetites?

294  
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:38,720  
To find out, the team need to get

295  
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,700  
down there themselves.

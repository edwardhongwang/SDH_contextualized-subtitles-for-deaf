1
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,370
Keith.

2
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,710
And I thought my jokes were bad. Give

3
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,070
me one reason why I shouldn't have my

4
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,830
boy here pull your head off. How about

5
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,890
a magic trick?

6
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:42,715
I'm gonna make this pencil

7
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:43,835
disappear.

8
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:46,635
It's

9
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:48,195
it's

10
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:49,755
gone.

11
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:53,115
You wanna know how I got these scars?

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,120
My father was

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,040
a drinker

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,880
and a fiend.

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,260
And one night, he goes off crazier than

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,760
usual.

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,145
Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.

18
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:14,865
He doesn't like that. Not one bit.

19
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:16,385
So

20
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:20,225
me watching, he takes the knife to her,

21
00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:21,870
laughing while he

22
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,610
does it. He turns to me

23
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,290
and he says,

24
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,770
why so serious?

25
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,290
He comes at me with the knife.

26
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,965
Why so serious?

27
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:38,885
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

28
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,045
Let's put a smile on that face.

29
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:48,325
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,000
We are

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,680
tonight's entertainment.

32
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,200
I only have one question.

33
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,960
Where is Harvey Dent?

34
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:08,205
You know where Harvey is? Do you know

35
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:10,685
who he is? It's simple. We, kill the

36
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:11,185
Batman.

37
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,005
If it's so simple, why haven't you done

38
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,165
it already? If you're good at something, never

39
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:18,225
do it for free.

40
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:20,225
How much you will?

41
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,000
Half.

42
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,080
You're crazy. I'm not.

43
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,320
No, I'm not.

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,400
Okay, stop.

45
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,525
Why, hello, beautiful.

46
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,645
You must be Harvey's squeeze.

47
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:46,405
And you are beautiful.

48
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,640
Well, you look nervous.

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,400
Is it the scars?

50
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,840
You wanna know how I got them?

51
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:03,605
Come here.

52
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:06,565
Hey. Look at me.

53
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:10,005
So I had a wife. You look beautiful

54
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:11,685
like you.

55
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:14,005
Who tells me

56
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:16,725
I worry too much?

57
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,440
Who tells me I ought to smile more?

58
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,060
Who gambles and gets in deep? The sharks.

59
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,960
I mean,

60
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,080
one day they carve her face.

61
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,800
We have no money for surgeries.

62
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,295
She can't take it.

63
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:35,755
I just wanna see her smile again.

64
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:38,855
I just want her to know that I

65
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:40,315
don't care about the scars.

66
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:41,675
So

67
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,255
I stick a razor in my mouth and

68
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:45,995
do this

69
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,130
to myself.

70
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,130
And you know what?

71
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,250
She can't stand the sight of me.

72
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,250
She leaves.

73
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,365
Now I see the funny side.

74
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,505
Now I'm always smiling.

75
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:09,105
A little fighting you. I like that. Evening,

76
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:11,585
commissioner.

77
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,720
Harvey Dent never made it home.

78
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,180
Of course not. What have you done with

79
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,680
him?

80
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,040
Me?

81
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:31,005
I was right here.

82
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,765
Who did you leave him with?

83
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:37,005
Your people?

84
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:41,545
Assuming, of course, that they are still your

85
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:42,045
people,

86
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,050
and not Marrone's.

87
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,490
Does it depress you, commissioner,

88
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,170
to know

89
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,090
just how alone you really are?

90
00:04:57,475 --> 00:05:00,755
Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey

91
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:03,495
Dent's current predicament? Where is he?

92
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:07,255
What's the time? What difference does that make?

93
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,875
Well, depending on the time, he may be

94
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,655
in one spot or several.

95
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:23,910
Hi.

96
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:30,145
You know,

97
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:33,325
I don't want there to be any hard

98
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:36,385
feelings between us, Harvey. When you and,

99
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,985
Rachel Rachel. Rachel were being abducted,

100
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,910
I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

101
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,730
No. I didn't read those charges. You're a

102
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,770
man. You're a plan. Do I really look

103
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,150
like a guy with a plan?

104
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,135
You know what I am? I'm a dog

105
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:56,135
chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do

106
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:58,295
with one if I caught it. You know,

107
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:00,315
I just do things.

108
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,955
The mob has plans. The cops have plans.

109
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:06,795
Gordon's got plans.

110
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,450
You know, they're schemers.

111
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,770
Schemers trying to control their little worlds.

112
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,350
I'm not a schemer. I try to show

113
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,530
the schemers how pathetic

114
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:23,205
their attempts to control things really are.

115
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:24,885
So

116
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:29,025
when I say, weird. When I say that

117
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:31,125
you and your girlfriend was nothing personal,

118
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,805
you know that I'm telling the truth.

119
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,940
Never start with the head. The victim gets

120
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,200
all fuzzy. You can't feel the neck.

121
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,720
See?

122
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,495
You wanted me. Here I am. You let

123
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,715
5 people die.

124
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:58,675
Then, you let Dent take your place.

125
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:01,455
Even to a guy like me, that's cold.

126
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,855
Where's Dent? Those mob fools want you gone

127
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:05,215
so they can get back to the way

128
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,060
things were.

129
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,060
But I know the truth. There's no going

130
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,000
back. You've changed things

131
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,200
forever. Then why do you wanna kill me?

132
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,395
I don't wanna kill you. What would I

133
00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:22,715
do without you? Go back to ripping off

134
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:26,415
mob dealers? No. No. No. No. You.

135
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:28,255
You complete

136
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,835
me. You're garbage who kills for money. Don't

137
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,535
talk like one of them. You're not.

138
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,820
Even if you'd like to be.

139
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,900
To them, you're just a freak.

140
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,500
Like me.

141
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,420
They need you right now.

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,060
And when they don't,

143
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,245
they'll cash you out. Like a leper.

144
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:53,605
See their morals, their code.

145
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,165
It's a bad joke.

146
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:59,685
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

147
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:03,265
They're only as good as the world allows

148
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:05,800
them to be. I'll show you. When the

149
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,780
chips are down,

150
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,220
these,

151
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,700
these civilized people, they'll eat each other.

152
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,500
See, I'm not a monster.

153
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:19,955
I'm just ahead of the curve. I took

154
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:22,535
your little plan. I turned it on itself.

155
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:25,235
Look what I did to this city with

156
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,155
a few drums of gas and a couple

157
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:27,815
of bullets.

158
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,280
You know what I noticed? Nobody panics when

159
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,900
things go according to plan.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,540
Even if the plan is horrifying.

161
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,560
If tomorrow I tell the press that like

162
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,735
a gang banger will get shot, or a

163
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:46,075
truckload of soldiers will be blowing up.

164
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:48,315
Nobody panics,

165
00:08:49,015 --> 00:08:51,595
because it's all part of the plan.

166
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:55,095
But when I say that one little old

167
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:56,235
mayor will die,

168
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,930
Well, then everyone loses their minds.

169
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,710
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle

170
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,830
for Gotham's soul in a fist fight with

171
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,330
you.

172
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,125
You need an ace in the hole.

173
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:15,545
Mine's Harvey.

174
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:17,465
What did you do?

175
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:20,505
I took Gotham's white knight,

176
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:22,265
and I

177
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:24,665
brought him down to our level.

178
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:28,340
It wasn't hard. See, madness, as you know,

179
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,060
is

180
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,580
like gravity.

181
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,180
All it takes is a little push.

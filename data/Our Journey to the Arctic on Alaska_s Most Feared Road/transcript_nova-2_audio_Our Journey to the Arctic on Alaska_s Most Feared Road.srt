1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,380
This is one of the world's most dangerous

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,100
roads,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,000
and it leads to a place on Earth

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,960
like no other, a place where trees cannot

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,460
grow,

6
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:16,645
where ice shapes the land in bizarre and

7
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:17,865
otherworldly ways,

8
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:21,685
and only life supremely adapted to the cold

9
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:22,345
can survive.

10
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,730
The Dalton Highway of Alaska pushes far beyond

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,690
the Arctic Circle, a lifeline carved through harsh

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,770
and unforgiving terrain, existing and only existing because

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,990
of this, one of the single greatest engineering

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,350
feats of all time.

15
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:51,985
Our destination is the very end of the

16
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,225
road, where the edge of North America meets

17
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:57,930
the Arctic Ocean. The question is, can we

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,230
make it in one piece?

19
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,850
In 5 years living on the road, we

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,250
have never put our bus through a test

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:06,910
like this.

22
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:12,815
Come make the journey with us. Experience part

23
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:14,975
of the world few has seen and join

24
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,815
us in finding out what it's like to

25
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:20,495
drive Alaska's most feared road. Into the Arctic

26
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,835
we go, welcome aboard.

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,620
This is not your average road trip. The

28
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,220
Dalton Highway stretches 414 miles across the most

29
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,338
remote expanse of the Alaskan Arctic. We will

30
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:42,208
pass through the boreal forest, cross the Arctic

31
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,078
Circle, climb a steep and dangerous pass over

32
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:47,949
Alaska's northernmost mountain range, then cross the vast

33
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:51,260
Arctic tundra to finally reach the Arctic Ocean.

34
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,260
There are only 3 small settlements along the

35
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,900
route, 2 places to fuel up, and no

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,780
services. When venturing to a remote place like

37
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,740
this, anything could go wrong, so you must

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,345
prepare for the worst, but hope for the

39
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:04,845
best.

40
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:07,465
Before we get on the Dalton, we make

41
00:02:07,465 --> 00:02:10,205
an important stop 9 miles north of Fairbanks,

42
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:13,385
Alaska. The Dalton Highway cannot be explored nor

43
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:16,425
appreciated without understanding its role and connection to

44
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:17,885
the Trans Alaska Pipeline.

45
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:21,680
It's hard to express just how groundbreaking the

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,440
construction and engineering of this pipeline was. This

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,640
single silver thread stretches 800 miles from the

48
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
edge of the Arctic Ocean to the ice

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,060
free port of Valdez, Alaska in the South.

50
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:37,025
Traverses 3 mountain ranges, 500 rivers and streams,

51
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:39,525
and 4 major fault and earthquake zones.

52
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:42,545
Here at this site, we are allowed to

53
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,785
walk right up to the pipeline, not a

54
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:48,220
replica, but the actual pipeline itself. As we

55
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,540
speak, 1,000 of dollars of crude oil are

56
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,860
flowing above our heads. We get to look

57
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,580
closely at its structure, in particular, these fin

58
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,900
like heat pipes that super chill the ground,

59
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,735
keeping the permafrost frozen and the pipeline stable.

60
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:03,675
We also see devices called PIGS that are

61
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:05,935
used to clean and inspect it from inside.

62
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:08,315
This older model was used in the early

63
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:10,895
pipeline. This model is used today.

64
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,550
In order to build the pipeline, a new

65
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,070
road had to be carved through one of

66
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,470
the most remote and harsh environments in the

67
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,350
world, a road which wasn't even open to

68
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,050
the public until 1994.

69
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,105
If you just found us now and you

70
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:29,425
are new to the channel, then welcome. We

71
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:31,585
are Cora and Jose, 2 artists with a

72
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,165
mission to take this beautiful beast from Alaska

73
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:35,685
to Argentina.

74
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:38,705
Bobby is our home and creative space on

75
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:41,290
wheels. If we can complete the Dalton with

76
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,330
no pop tires, no major breakdowns or toes,

77
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,970
and an intact windshield, we'll call that a

78
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,470
win.

79
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:57,345
We hit the road at mile 0 excited

80
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:00,145
for the journey ahead. Now the Dalton cannot

81
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:01,745
be done in a day. It is an

82
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:03,925
expedition that must be tackled in steps.

83
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,690
Our first major landmark will be the Yukon

84
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,730
River, 56 miles away, but we will stop

85
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,210
to sleep soon. Even though this is midnight

86
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,790
in early July, the dim light of nighttime

87
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,650
doesn't do this region justice. It's worth it

88
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,410
to take it slow because what we will

89
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,395
see between mile 0 and the Yukon deserves

90
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,875
to be explored by the bright light of

91
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,375
day.

92
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:31,435
The Dalton Highway spans 3 distinct regions, each

93
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:33,995
with its own plant and animal community adapted

94
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:34,815
to its environment.

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,080
Right now, we are in the taiga, also

96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,780
known as the boreal forest.

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,440
The taiga is the largest forest ecosystem in

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,080
the world, forming a band that encircles the

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,460
entire northern hemisphere.

100
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,445
The first 50 miles of the Dalton cut

101
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:53,765
through the taiga, which is often called one

102
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:56,245
of the lungs of the planet. It covers

103
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:59,445
17% of Earth's land surface and stores twice

104
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:01,980
as much carbon per acre as tropical rain

105
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,420
forests. So far, the road is kind, but

106
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,660
we don't let our guard down. We're lucky

107
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,600
to be driving when the roads are dry.

108
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,800
The narrow packed lane and soft muddy shoulders

109
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,525
say it all. This road in the rain

110
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:16,745
would not be fun.

111
00:05:18,805 --> 00:05:20,805
Before we know it, we arrive at a

112
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:24,185
force of the natural world, the Yukon River.

113
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,020
The mighty Yukon River is the longest river

114
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,900
in both Alaska and the Yukon Territory of

115
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,400
Canada.

116
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,900
It flows nearly 2,000 miles from its headwaters

117
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,460
in British Columbia through the Yukon, which is

118
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,125
named after the river, then through Alaska, where

119
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,925
it finally empties into the Bering Sea. To

120
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,845
give a sense of just how big and

121
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:49,565
powerful this river is, its average flow is

122
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,905
about a quarter of a 1000000 cubic feet

123
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:52,945
per second.

124
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,990
Despite its sheer length, there are only 4

125
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,950
vehicle bearing bridges that cross the Yukon, 3

126
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,670
are in Canada, and only one is in

127
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,170
Alaska.

128
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:09,395
The e l Patton Bridge was completed in

129
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:09,895
1975.

130
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:11,735
It is 2,295

131
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:15,315
feet long and 30 feet wide, a steel

132
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:18,035
girder bridge with a timber driving surface. It

133
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:21,600
transports both vehicles and the pipeline across the

134
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,840
Yukon. During construction of the bridge, a staging

135
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,000
area was established on the northern bank of

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,560
the Yukon, and a camp remains here to

137
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,175
this day. It's here to provide food and

138
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:41,015
lodging, and it's one of the 2 places

139
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:43,115
to fuel up on the entire route.

140
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,820
The cost of diesel today is a whopping

141
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,760
7.50 per gallon. If you can believe it,

142
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,080
this isn't the most expensive diesel we've ever

143
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,720
bought. 2 years ago, we paid over $9

144
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,740
a gallon driving up the Alaska highway.

145
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:14,485
Now, this is only one of 3 places

146
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:16,805
to eat on the entire Dalton Highway, so

147
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,825
we duck in to enjoy a hot meal.

148
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,100
We are a 135 miles from civilization, and

149
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,180
we can already feel the disconnect from the

150
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,500
rest of the world. Cell service ended a

151
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,220
long time ago, and even Internet isn't easy

152
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,880
to find.

153
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,940
The cafe at Yukon River Camp is humble

154
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,365
and cozy. We especially love seeing this wall

155
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:45,465
covered in handwritten signs from travelers across the

156
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,465
globe translating the original sign that kindly asks

157
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:51,245
visitors to stay out of the kitchen.

158
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:54,290
It's things like this, those little acts of

159
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,790
camaraderie that make the world a better place,

160
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,210
as do little acts of kindness. So we'd

161
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,810
like to take this moment to say thank

162
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,970
you to our new friends who surprised us

163
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,405
today and treated us to this delicious meal.

164
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,700
The next section of road is notorious for

165
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,200
its steep grades and often slick conditions.

166
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,400
Hills on this stretch have nicknames like beaverslide

167
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,920
and roller coaster.

168
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:37,645
If you're curious who named them, well, it's

169
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,885
important to understand that the Dalton is not

170
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:42,205
here for us. The road was built as

171
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,805
a supply route to the oil fields of

172
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:46,045
Prudhoe Bay. The bay is ice bound a

173
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:47,725
good portion of the year, so the main

174
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:50,350
way to transport all the tools, supplies, and

175
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,150
machinery for the massive operation up there is

176
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,630
by semi truck. That's why the road was

177
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,210
originally called the haul road, and the badass

178
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,230
truckers that drive it year round have names

179
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,305
for parts of the road. Names like Surprise

180
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:07,505
Rise, The Ice Cut, and O Shit Corner.

181
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:14,125
This is where we start to put our

182
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,730
bus to the test. The hills are deceiving.

183
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,910
They don't look steep until you're on them,

184
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,750
and the potholes make it really hard to

185
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,650
gain momentum. So it's a bit nerve wracking,

186
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,870
but our Bobby tackles hill after hill after

187
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,370
hill.

188
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,375
We make it to Finger Mountain, a place

189
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,735
of special significance, not realizing that tomorrow morning

190
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,335
we'll get a knock on the door from

191
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:40,635
a surprise visitor.

192
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,170
Now this encounter is one for the books.

193
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,710
Rewind a few weeks, and we are driving

194
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,370
through Alaska en route to Denali National Park.

195
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,330
We meet an ambitious young traveler from Germany

196
00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:01,495
on a journey to ride his bicycle from

197
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:04,615
Vancouver Island to the Arctic Ocean. We joke

198
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:06,695
that we travel so slow in the bus

199
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:09,175
that he will probably beat us there, and

200
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,035
sure enough, he did.

201
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,710
Now here in a beautiful little traveler's twist

202
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,870
of fate, our paths cross again on the

203
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,750
Dalton. Us on our way up and Luis

204
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,810
on his way down.

205
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,445
Let's see here. Okay.

206
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,645
Please, look. You don't have to. Wait there.

207
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:27,785
Hold on. Hold

208
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:29,585
on.

209
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:31,385
Hold

210
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,285
on. Hold on. So you think in the

211
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:37,785
entire trip, this is, the toughest?

212
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,305
Yeah.

213
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,210
Well, I think the first gravel road, big

214
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,370
gravel road I've done. I mean, it's not

215
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,990
even gravel road. It's just mud.

216
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,190
It's a lot of time. Just mud,

217
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,275
especially with the rain. It's job.

218
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,215
I love it.

219
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:57,315
I love the adventure. Especially on this kind

220
00:10:57,315 --> 00:11:00,195
of road, when it's a lonely road. Nowhere,

221
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:01,735
people take care of each other.

222
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:05,540
That's what I like. Mhmm. I'm excited to

223
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,400
go to South America too. Like,

224
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,380
my plan is to Canada and then maybe

225
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,780
work again and then down the states in

226
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,400
South America or South America.

227
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,540
I don't know. Alright. Ready for the road

228
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,295
again. Keep going.

229
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,015
Nice.

230
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:24,815
Alright. I got it.

231
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:28,495
Thank you, guys. Thank you so much.

232
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,290
That's a lot of things you're carrying in

233
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,070
this bike. Yeah. So,

234
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,330
here in front, I just just, I mean,

235
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,410
this is my tent. It's not a not

236
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,330
a good stuff, not the pro stuff, but

237
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,110
it's, you know, it's working. So

238
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,550
it's pretty

239
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:50,365
pretty basic. Like, what I got here.

240
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:53,645
It's just, it's a stove.

241
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:56,925
Wow. Just a stove, one pot.

242
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:02,460
And then some electronic devices here. Power banks,

243
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:02,960
drone.

244
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,880
And then my my my clothes are here.

245
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,440
Just, you know, my my suitcase.

246
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,880
And then I got my pillow,

247
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,080
my sleeping bag, mattress

248
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:19,095
in here. It's quite big. Everything it's not

249
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,495
like the small tiny stuff. And on the

250
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:23,335
other side, I carry some food too. So

251
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:25,755
I got all the bag full of food

252
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,655
and some food here and the stove and

253
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:32,500
the pot and that's it. And of course,

254
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,260
I got some small things to repair the

255
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,440
bike too. Some, yeah, tubes or whatever.

256
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,040
Carry this kind of things, rain pants.

257
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,125
Yeah. Nothing too crazy, but, yeah. But you

258
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,125
got everything you need in there? Everything I

259
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,665
need and, everything to survive. Easy.

260
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:52,665
My whole life.

261
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:55,225
My whole life.

262
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,570
Well, it's been awesome.

263
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,050
It was so nice to meet you guys.

264
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,270
Honestly, like, maybe see you on the road,

265
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,965
like, if if Canada, America, South America. Thank

266
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:14,005
you, Tom. I will be there. I will

267
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:16,405
be there. Yeah. We'll see you. And then

268
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:17,225
see you somewhere.

269
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,005
We have a feeling this isn't the last

270
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:23,940
time our story will share a page with

271
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,820
Luisa's. This is one of those beautiful and

272
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,980
also slightly tragic parts of life on the

273
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,300
road. When you meet a fellow nomad, you

274
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,460
get to connect with someone who really gets

275
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,020
you and you get them. There's an ease

276
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,860
and understanding that can be hard to find

277
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,360
elsewhere.

278
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,965
But then that same thing that brought you

279
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:43,865
together makes you say goodbye all too soon.

280
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,570
We spend a few days in the company

281
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,690
of Finger Mountain, an unmistakable landmark in this

282
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,830
wide open landscape.

283
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,595
Once upon a time, native peoples of the

284
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:14,675
interior knew it as a prime spot to

285
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:17,875
watch for game. Later, bush pilots used it

286
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,455
to aid in navigation, as the finger conveniently

287
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:21,975
points towards Fairbanks.

288
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,380
Finger Mountain, just like its neighbors near the

289
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,100
bus, is a granite tor, a block of

290
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,300
hard durable granite that resists erosion while everything

291
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,540
around it is more easily whittled away by

292
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,040
time.

293
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:40,225
This granite dates back a 110000000 years when

294
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:42,465
it first cooled from magma that crept into

295
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,525
cracks in the bedrock.

296
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:47,105
There will come a time in this drive

297
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:49,105
when we leave the trees behind, but we're

298
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:51,745
not there yet. The Finger Mountain area is

299
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:54,680
an upland region, rising just high enough above

300
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,360
the surrounding boreal forest that here, alpine tundra

301
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,860
prevails.

302
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,080
The tundra is dominated by hardy, ground hugging

303
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,300
plants that withstand hurricane force winds and temperatures

304
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,900
of 80 below 0,

305
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:12,035
and creatures that amazingly can withstand the same.

306
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,295
Every now and then, Willow Charmigan, Alaska's state

307
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:17,315
bird, pop in and out of the shrubbery.

308
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:19,935
These tough little fowl are currently in their

309
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:22,655
summer clothes, dappled brown to blend in with

310
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,450
the tundra. Come fall, their plumage will shift

311
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,690
to pure white to camouflage with the land

312
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,990
in its winter form.

313
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,050
One can only imagine this land in that

314
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,750
form, windswept and frozen, covered in pure white.

315
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,955
It must be quite a sight to behold.

316
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:50,475
Our goal today is to reach the mountains

317
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:53,510
and cross Adogan Pass. Snow falls year round

318
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,510
up there, so this hot sunny day just

319
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,370
might be our window to get over safely.

320
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,750
It's a 150 miles away, and there is

321
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,590
a whole lot to see between here and

322
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,090
there.

323
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,255
At mile 107, we pass Old Man Camp,

324
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:10,495
one of more than 31 working camps that

325
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,595
dotted the route during the pipeline's construction.

326
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,375
Now, most of them, like this one, are

327
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,235
little more than relics of the past.

328
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,580
The road shifts back and forth between gravel

329
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,400
and pavement.

330
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,340
And, honestly, it's hard to decide which is

331
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,460
preferable. The gravel has more potholes, but the

332
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,915
pavement is frost heavy.

333
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,075
Still, overall, the road is being kind. So

334
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,995
kind, in fact, that in no time, we

335
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:42,575
arrive at a big milestone of this journey.

336
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,460
We made it to the Arctic Circle. I

337
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,380
can't believe it has been almost 5 years

338
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,540
since we got on the road. Bobby bus

339
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,180
made it, and now here we are. Yeah.

340
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,340
And here's to hoping this old Florida bus

341
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,340
can get us now all the way up

342
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,005
to dead horse.

343
00:17:01,885 --> 00:17:03,725
Okay. We're gonna leave a little baby Bobby

344
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:05,025
here at the Arctic Circle.

345
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:07,825
Right about there.

346
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,290
The Arctic Circle is an imaginary line that

347
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,490
circles the globe at approximately 66 degrees north

348
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,310
of the equator.

349
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,010
Here on this line, the sun never sets

350
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,475
on the summer solstice. The farther north you

351
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:31,635
go, the more days of 24 hour sunlight

352
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,035
you get until reaching the North Pole where

353
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:36,535
the sun doesn't set for a 180 days.

354
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:39,655
In the winter, the exact opposite is true.

355
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,970
We now push north of the Arctic Circle.

356
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,930
The amount of land up here is staggering.

357
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,830
3 national wildlife refuges and 1 national park

358
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,415
protect over 37,000,000

359
00:17:58,115 --> 00:18:00,355
acres of land up here. Much of the

360
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,935
rest is state and Alaska native lands.

361
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:06,435
In the distance, we see a glimmer of

362
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:09,555
the challenge that lies ahead, crossing the Brooks

363
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,020
Range.

364
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,820
Just like the pipeline, we will have to

365
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,600
climb over that great boundary.

366
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,620
When the pipeline descends on this side of

367
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,340
the mountains, steep grades cause the oil to

368
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,980
speed up, and the pump station ahead plays

369
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,365
a critical role in reregulating flow.

370
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,125
In total, 12 pump stations are positioned along

371
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,785
the pipeline, each capable of moving 22,000

372
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:34,905
gallons of crude oil per minute.

373
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,845
4 of the pump stations are in use

374
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:40,245
today. And while most of them move oil

375
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,530
along, pump station 5 is charged with slowing

376
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,410
it down as thousands of gallons of hot

377
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,510
crude descend out of the Brooks Range.

378
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,410
Here, we also see a critical feature of

379
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,010
the pipeline's design, the Zig Zag Formation. This

380
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,565
allows for expansion or contraction of the pipeline

381
00:18:58,565 --> 00:19:01,365
due to extreme temperature changes, as well as

382
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:03,465
play and movement during an earthquake.

383
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,110
We are still in the taiga, though approaching

384
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,970
its northern edge. In Alaska, the taiga is

385
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,250
dominated by spruce, but these tall skinny pipe

386
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,490
cleaners look a lot different from their Christmas

387
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,790
tree kin to the south.

388
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:25,835
Up here, spruce trees grow slender and far

389
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:28,235
apart to intercept the slanted sunlight that they

390
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:31,675
receive, and an acutely short summer forces them

391
00:19:31,675 --> 00:19:34,155
to grow slow. Here, a tree that has

392
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:36,650
lived a 150 years may have a trunk

393
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,430
just 2 inches across.

394
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,570
We are now moving through the Jack White

395
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,050
Range, a mere prelude to the Brooks Range

396
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,790
just beyond.

397
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:51,025
The road continues to shift back and forth

398
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:54,065
between pavement and gravel. The biggest challenge is

399
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:56,705
not getting too comfortable on those smooth even

400
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,545
stretches that make you want to hit highway

401
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:02,030
speeds. It's tempting, but frost heaves and deep

402
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,590
potholes come out of nowhere, and this is

403
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,110
not a place to pop a tire or

404
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,010
break an axle.

405
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,590
In 1971, the coldest temperature ever recorded in

406
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,145
the United States was locked here along this

407
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,705
stretch of the road. The temperature reading came

408
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:20,605
in at a whopping negative 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

409
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:25,465
With daylight to spare, we arrive in Cold

410
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:28,365
Foot, Alaska, gateway to the Brooks Range.

411
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,830
Cold Foot is just about as sparse as

412
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,390
Yukon River Camp. It began as a gold

413
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,035
mining camp in 1900, and the story goes

414
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,675
that many miners got cold feet and turned

415
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:49,475
back after experiencing the harsh reality of winter

416
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:49,975
here.

417
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:52,755
The camp was abandoned with the discovery of

418
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:54,995
gold 10 miles north and it wasn't until

419
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:57,075
the construction of the pipeline that Cold Foot

420
00:20:57,075 --> 00:21:01,540
was resurrected into construction camp. Today, it serves

421
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,540
as the last stop for food, fuel, and

422
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,180
water on the Dalton. There's a tire shop,

423
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,100
a trucker's cafe, humble lodging, and not much

424
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,025
else. After this lie 240 miles of pure

425
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:15,805
wilderness until dead horse.

426
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:19,705
Though there is an award winning gem just

427
00:21:19,705 --> 00:21:20,765
across the road.

428
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:25,145
The Arctic Interagency Visitor Center is a partnership

429
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:27,480
between the National Park Service, the Bureau of

430
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,640
Land Management, and the US Fish and Wildlife

431
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,940
Service, and it is an amazing place.

432
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,385
This is where we dive deep into learning

433
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,025
about the unique and extreme environment of the

434
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:49,225
arctic. The margin for survival is narrow here,

435
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,025
and only the most supremely adapted species can

436
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,325
call this place home.

437
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,560
We are both excited and nervous for what

438
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,280
lies ahead. Excited because we are about to

439
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,860
leave the familiar behind and enter a strange

440
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,520
treeless land. But also nervous because this is

441
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,840
where we begin the climb into that Great

442
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,405
Wall of the North, the Brooks Range.

443
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:23,465
Today is the day we leave the taiga

444
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:26,185
behind and venture into that great barrier of

445
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:26,845
the North.

446
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,690
Sweeping like an arc across Alaska's Wild North,

447
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,050
these mountains separate 2 worlds, the Forrester Taiga

448
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,690
of the Interior and the vast treeless plains

449
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,510
of the Arctic.

450
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,785
At 700 miles long, they form America's longest

451
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:45,485
east west trending range and cover a 5th

452
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:47,725
of the state of Alaska, yet they are

453
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,885
so remote and so far north, only a

454
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:52,305
handful of communities call this place home.

455
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,890
Small lakes and ponds dotting the taiga are

456
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,870
actually thermokarsts,

457
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,970
sinkholes of the north. When ice in the

458
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,015
ground melts, craters

459
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,040
Sukukpak means marten deadfall in the language of

460
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,620
the Inupiat, Alaska's northernmost peoples.

461
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,240
It is so named because when viewed from

462
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,640
the north, the mountain resembles the balanced log

463
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,860
of a deadfall trap.

464
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:35,475
Soukikpak is a monolith of pure limestone thrust

465
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:36,455
into the sky.

466
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:40,595
Limestone forms in tropical marine environments, which means

467
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:43,690
that, yes, strange as it may seem, a

468
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,930
page of the Brooks Range story includes a

469
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,410
time when a warm shallow sea covered the

470
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,850
land. Fossils of clams, coral, and other marine

471
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,250
creatures can be found even on the high

472
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,790
ridges of the Brooks Range.

473
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,280
During this journey along the Dalton, you may

474
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,000
have noticed that sometimes the pipeline courses alongside

475
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,160
us, and sometimes it disappears entirely. Where does

476
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,820
it go?

477
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,120
That is part of the genius of the

478
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,180
pipeline's engineering.

479
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:25,565
420 miles of the pipeline is insulated and

480
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,125
elevated above ground. This was done in areas

481
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,065
where the oil's heat could melt the permafrost

482
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,925
and destabilize the pipeline. The rest of the

483
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:36,670
pipeline's 380 miles is buried underground.

484
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,050
We climbed steadily into the Brooks Range, and

485
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,150
the trees are still holding on for now,

486
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,195
but we are rapidly approaching another big milestone

487
00:24:50,195 --> 00:24:52,755
in the journey, the moment we cross the

488
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:53,575
tree line.

489
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:56,515
The Arctic tree line is one of the

490
00:24:56,515 --> 00:25:00,300
most significant ecological boundaries on our planet. It

491
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,020
circles the globe's northern landmasses, marking the point

492
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,420
at which conditions are simply too harsh for

493
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,400
trees to grow.

494
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,420
The tree line is not a hard, linear

495
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,160
boundary like the Arctic Circle. It is dynamic,

496
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,700
shifting with the conditions and contours of the

497
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,315
land. In fact, this stretch of the Dalton

498
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,955
is ground 0 for scientists currently studying the

499
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:22,675
tree line's rapid progression north as the climate

500
00:25:22,675 --> 00:25:23,175
warms.

501
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:27,555
As we climb, we can feel it. The

502
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:30,360
tree line must be close and sure enough,

503
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,300
it's right around the bend.

504
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,280
We round the corner and the spruce trees

505
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,260
are gone. A few tall shrubs hang on,

506
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:47,335
and then quite suddenly,

507
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:49,655
we're crossing the tree line.

508
00:26:24,235 --> 00:26:26,875
We just climbed onto the Chandelar Shelf, a

509
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,035
broad glacial valley that acts much like a

510
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:31,800
stepping stool into the range. We are now

511
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,280
officially past the tree line at 32 100

512
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,260
feet and climbing.

513
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,840
This valley is a major avalanche zone in

514
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,400
the winter. The pipeline lies buried to our

515
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,445
right, too precious to risk destruction from slides.

516
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:47,305
Throughout the winter, artillery shells are used to

517
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,025
clear the slopes above the highway. Just another

518
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,425
example of how the reality of this highway

519
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:53,725
changes with the seasons.

520
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,620
Even with these incredibly good driving conditions today,

521
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,215
we feel the risk of this road. On

522
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:14,355
the Dalton, the rules are very clear. Truckers

523
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:16,175
have the right of way. If we have

524
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:18,415
to share the road with anyone here, we'll

525
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:20,735
be the ones sliding in thick mud. And

526
00:27:20,735 --> 00:27:22,835
we know how our bus handles in mud,

527
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:23,820
not well.

528
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,880
Luckily we make it through without meeting anyone,

529
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,940
but it does feel a bit out of

530
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,260
the frying pan and into the fire, because

531
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,660
we are rapidly approaching one of the biggest

532
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,960
tests of the Dalton.

533
00:27:40,815 --> 00:27:44,915
Adagan Pass, Alaska's highest year round mountain pass,

534
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:48,255
a steep, unrelenting climb to the summit, fighting

535
00:27:48,255 --> 00:27:51,230
12% grades and loose gravel, all on a

536
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,170
slender ribbon cut into the mountainside.

537
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,290
The margin for error here is 0.

538
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,110
We have been on edge about this moment

539
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,830
because up here, even high summer can't protect

540
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,450
you from dangerous road conditions.

541
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,825
Snow falls year round and rain can transform

542
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:10,305
the pass into a slick muddy slide with

543
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:11,445
little to no visibility.

544
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:14,865
We are hyper aware that we are asking

545
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:16,405
a lot of this old bus.

546
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:18,085
But you know what?

547
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:19,740
She rocks

548
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,320
it.

549
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:37,335
After a 2.5 mile climb, Adigun Pass tops

550
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:39,975
out at 47 100 feet in elevation, the

551
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:41,915
highest point on the Dalton Highway.

552
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:47,790
Now, the descent begins.

553
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,210
Another 2.5 miles of equally steep downhill grades

554
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,770
on an equally narrow ribbon of road.

555
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,250
Coming up was a test of Bobbie's engine.

556
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,815
Now comes the test of her brakes.

557
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,070
Breathing a big and grateful sigh of relief,

558
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,130
the road levels out beneath us and we

559
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,090
come out into Adogan Valley. Our bus made

560
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,770
it through and we are ready for the

561
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,150
next stage of the journey.

562
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:41,105
Crossing Adogan Pass and dropping down into the

563
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:43,585
northern side of the Brooks Range is, in

564
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:45,985
a very real way, like entering a whole

565
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:46,885
different world.

566
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,080
We have entered a treeless world of blinding

567
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,660
extremes where frozen ground and sunlight dictate every

568
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,600
rule life must follow to survive.

569
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,125
And in crossing Edin Pass, we traversed yet

570
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,865
another significant boundary on planet Earth.

571
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:37,445
The Great Divide of the Americas splits North

572
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:40,505
and South America in 2, stretching from Alaska

573
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:43,060
to Chile. On the eastern side of the

574
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,460
divide, all rivers lead to one ocean. On

575
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,400
the western side, they lead to another.

576
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,080
Before Adagan Pass, every river we saw eventually

577
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,400
ends in the Pacific or the Bering Sea.

578
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,355
Now, here on this side, every waterway we

579
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,615
see is destined for the Arctic Ocean.

580
00:31:26,495 --> 00:31:28,575
To our right, the Adagin River braids along

581
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:30,495
the valley floor right at the beginning of

582
00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:32,275
its journey to the Arctic Ocean.

583
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,775
The river seems as fitting a companion as

584
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:37,615
any for a couple nights stay in the

585
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:38,490
Brooks Range.

586
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:55,205
Got some flowers. Oh, those are beautiful.

587
00:32:58,785 --> 00:33:02,245
I made you some tea. Oh, thank you.

588
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,380
My pleasure.

589
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,660
Cheers.

590
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,460
It's funny how perspective works.

591
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,920
Camped here within the very spine of the

592
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,320
range, we are surrounded by a burst of

593
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,615
life. Wildflowers are in full bloom, green carpets

594
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:22,215
the ground and creeps as high up the

595
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:23,435
mountains as it can go.

596
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,535
It's easy to forget that this version of

597
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:28,475
events is extremely fleeting.

598
00:33:29,095 --> 00:33:31,190
Life up here has just a few short

599
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,870
months to awaken, reproduce, then prepare for the

600
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,170
deep freeze once more.

601
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,430
We are witnessing a land in the maddest

602
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,230
of scrambles before the sun disappears and the

603
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,770
long darkness returns.

604
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:15,465
The range begins to show its other face.

605
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:18,265
It's mid July, but that means nothing here.

606
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:20,485
A cold wet wind sweeps down from the

607
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:23,045
peaks, chilling and reminding us where we really

608
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:23,545
are.

609
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:25,685
Our goal today is to make it all

610
00:34:25,685 --> 00:34:27,330
the way through the range and catch a

611
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,470
glimpse of what lies beyond. The broad glacially

612
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,170
carved corridor of Adigun Valley is our path

613
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,310
out of the mountains.

614
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:48,785
We witness the relentless movement of freight to

615
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:51,185
and from the oil fields, and marvel at

616
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:52,800
the grit of the Daltons' truckers.

617
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,360
We have the luxury of waiting to drive

618
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,300
on good days. They don't.

619
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,540
Through mud, blizzards, squalls, and sub zero temperatures,

620
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,080
they haul. Driving this road in the summer

621
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,960
has its challenges. We can't even imagine taking

622
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,215
it on in winter.

623
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,140
The mountains here tell a story written in

624
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,980
dramatic and tilted layers. About a 150000000 years

625
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,620
ago, the collision of 2 tectonic plates thrust

626
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,980
all that ancient seabed into the sky. Layers

627
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,925
that were once horizontal were folded, twisted, and

628
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:41,585
tilted, and in some cases, even inverted.

629
00:35:42,205 --> 00:35:44,285
As strange as it may seem, here the

630
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:47,825
sedimentary layers of this ancient seabed are upside

631
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:48,385
down.

632
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,440
It's hard to drive for miles alongside the

633
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,680
pipeline and not marvel at the speed with

634
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,355
which it was completed. When oil was discovered

635
00:36:06,355 --> 00:36:08,995
in Prudhoe Bay in 1968, the country was

636
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:10,915
in the midst of an energy crisis. So

637
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:13,235
the rally around this project was swift and

638
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:15,635
spared no expense. It took 5 months to

639
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:17,875
build the road and only 3 years to

640
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:18,935
complete the pipeline.

641
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,540
We made it through the Brooks Range, and

642
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,020
the next stage of the journey awaits, but

643
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,340
we're tired. So we decide to camp and

644
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,640
rest up for the night.

645
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:46,440
We awake near the shores of Galbraith Lake,

646
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,280
all that remains of a glacial lake that

647
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,820
once filled Adogan Valley.

648
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,840
After that ancient seabed was thrust into the

649
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,980
sky, glaciers, wind, and time set to work.

650
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,840
Over the past 3000000 years, the Brooks Range

651
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,655
has been glaciated 3 times, carving it into

652
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:03,115
the form we see today.

653
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,200
We are surrounded by an unfathomable amount of

654
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,660
wilderness in every direction.

655
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,520
Gates of the Arctic National Park lies to

656
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,240
the west, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

657
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,300
to the east. Combined, they protect over 28,000,000

658
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,365
acres of the Brooks Range and North Slope,

659
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:33,625
a North Slope that now awaits right at

660
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:34,285
our doorstep.

661
00:37:36,665 --> 00:37:39,385
We've been blessed with another incredible driving day,

662
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:40,845
and we're taking it.

663
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:46,190
We now enter the 3rd and final ecoregion

664
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,170
of the journey, the one which will prove

665
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,210
most unfamiliar of all. The sun is shining,

666
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,930
spirits are high, and then we make our

667
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,710
first big error on the Dalton.

668
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,390
We get cocky.

669
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:03,905
After our bus killed it on Atigun Pass,

670
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:06,625
we're thinking that it's all literally downhill from

671
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,125
here.

672
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:10,225
Then we hit roadwork with single lane traffic

673
00:38:10,225 --> 00:38:12,165
and deep slippery mud.

674
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,860
Here is where we get our first real

675
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
true taste of what this road can become

676
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,620
when conditions aren't ideal,

677
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,475
and it's not fun.

678
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:29,695
This is the first time we feel a

679
00:38:29,695 --> 00:38:32,255
little trepidation about the drive back. What if

680
00:38:32,255 --> 00:38:33,935
we don't get the same conditions on the

681
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:35,235
way back down the Dalton?

682
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:05,445
With the sketchy roadwork behind us, we can

683
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:08,350
breathe out and take in the strange foreign

684
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,290
world that is the North Slope.

685
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:19,515
The North Slope is aptly named. A long

686
00:39:19,515 --> 00:39:22,075
gentle slope of Arctic Tundra stretching as far

687
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:23,915
as the eye can see, leading from the

688
00:39:23,915 --> 00:39:25,595
edge of the Brooks Range down to the

689
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:26,575
Arctic Ocean.

690
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:31,915
Only low ground hugging vegetation can survive the

691
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:34,575
fierce wind, dark, and cold of this region.

692
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,740
Here, snow falls year round, there are only

693
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,060
6 weeks of summer without frost, and the

694
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,200
sun never rises from November 18th to January

695
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:43,760
23rd.

696
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,980
We are not the only ones making our

697
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,315
way down to sea level. The Sag River

698
00:39:50,315 --> 00:39:52,315
courses to our right, one of the major

699
00:39:52,315 --> 00:39:55,195
waterways of the North Slope. Sag is short

700
00:39:55,195 --> 00:39:55,855
for Sagavenirktok,

701
00:39:56,475 --> 00:39:58,735
an Inupiat word for swift current.

702
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,475
Strange fishes swim these waters, species like Arctic

703
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:05,210
grayling and Arctic charr. In a way, we

704
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,930
are now reunited with Adegan River. It joined

705
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,870
the Sagar River 20 miles upstream.

706
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:30,095
About 60 miles from the ocean, the North

707
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,755
Slope levels out onto a wide coastal plain.

708
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,470
Imagine driving for days on rough, rustic road,

709
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,290
and then suddenly, it shifts to this.

710
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,170
The last stretch of the Dalton is pristine,

711
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,390
almost like an award for making it this

712
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,210
far unscathed.

713
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,165
To be here in this place is a

714
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:50,345
big moment for our journey across the Americas.

715
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:52,805
To venture this far North was always a

716
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:55,525
gamble, a risk we took on, and we're

717
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:57,225
so happy that we did.

718
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,435
The coastal plain of the North Slope is

719
00:41:23,435 --> 00:41:27,320
a truly fascinating place where strange animals roam

720
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,820
and even stranger features mark the landscape.

721
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,680
Little do we know just how much of

722
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,160
this place is about to reveal itself to

723
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,660
us.

724
00:41:40,795 --> 00:41:43,195
With only 5 inches of rain per year,

725
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:45,195
the coastal plains should be as dry as

726
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:48,395
the Atacama Desert, and yet, it is a

727
00:41:48,395 --> 00:41:51,035
vast, marshy wetland stretching as far as the

728
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:53,375
eye can see. How can that be?

729
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,750
It's all because of the permafrost.

730
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,850
Permafrost is ground that stays frozen for 2

731
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,010
years or more. While about a foot of

732
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,670
soil, called the active layer, thaws and refreezes

733
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,335
every year, the underlying permafrost does not. Here,

734
00:42:07,335 --> 00:42:10,375
the permafrost forms an impenetrable barrier beneath the

735
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,875
coastal plain, trapping water on the surface.

736
00:42:14,455 --> 00:42:16,615
The wetland it creates is a boon for

737
00:42:16,615 --> 00:42:19,335
migratory birds who flock here from across the

738
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:23,220
world. They come from Asia, Africa, South America,

739
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,420
even Antarctica.

740
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,080
In summer, the plain bursts into life, providing

741
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,560
a short lived but bountiful buffet of small

742
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,460
fish and insects, grasses, and sedges.

743
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:36,695
Here on the coastal plain, the permafrost can

744
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:40,295
reach up to 2,000 feet thick. Ice does

745
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:42,775
strange things to the land here, both below

746
00:42:42,775 --> 00:42:45,815
and above the surface. Ice wedge polygons are

747
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:48,890
one of those bizarre features. They form when

748
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,530
the ground contracts and cracks in winter similar

749
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,010
to a dry lake bed. The following summer,

750
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,410
water fills the cracks just to refreeze and

751
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,970
further force the ground apart come winter. It

752
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,375
takes centuries, but eventually enough freeze thaw cycles

753
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:05,915
will turn an otherwise uniformed landscape into this.

754
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:13,755
Another ice formed feature rises in the distance,

755
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:16,875
a lonely hill in an otherwise flat landscape.

756
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,210
This is a pingo. Once upon a time,

757
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,690
this pingo was a shallow pond that insulated

758
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,610
and kept the ground beneath it from fully

759
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,430
freezing. When the pond dried up, the permafrost

760
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,655
encroached, encircling and then squeezing water from the

761
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:37,355
unfrozen soil. This squeezing forced the water upwards

762
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:39,735
where it froze in an icy mass that

763
00:43:39,735 --> 00:43:41,515
pushed up the land above it.

764
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,930
Migratory birds are one thing, but it's hard

765
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,490
to imagine large mammals eking out living in

766
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:55,950
this marshy land, and yet they do.

767
00:44:04,085 --> 00:44:06,085
It's not only birds that take advantage of

768
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:07,625
the Coastal Plains bounty.

769
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,805
Alaska is home to 31 Caribou herds that

770
00:44:10,805 --> 00:44:13,445
migrate with the seasons, following food and the

771
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:15,870
best place to birth their young. In summer,

772
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,670
they feast on tundra plants, mushrooms, sedges, and

773
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,910
willow. In the fall, they will migrate to

774
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:23,410
the Brooks Range and survive mainly on lichen.

775
00:44:29,305 --> 00:44:31,385
Calves are born in early June and must

776
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:33,625
grow quickly to prepare for the fast approaching

777
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:36,665
winter. Healthy females give birth to 1 calf

778
00:44:36,665 --> 00:44:39,065
per year, spending their summers caring for their

779
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:41,490
current generation, then rut begins in the fall

780
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,590
and the cycle starts all over again.

781
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,530
By late August, bulls will begin to shed

782
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,690
the velvet on their antlers, marking the start

783
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,710
of the breeding season and the fall migration

784
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:53,810
South. Once in migration mode, caribou herds can

785
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,485
cover a surprising amount of ground, traveling up

786
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,345
to 50 miles per day.

787
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,900
Mosquitoes constantly harass caribou, to the extent that

788
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,420
scientists believe migration patterns take this bothersome nuisance

789
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,240
into account.

790
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:25,735
North Slope caribou come to the windswept coastal

791
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:28,535
plain seeking relief, and they often climb to

792
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:31,335
higher ground, even elevated road beds, to catch

793
00:45:31,335 --> 00:45:32,635
a break from the bugs.

794
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,680
Out here on the coastal plain, the Sag

795
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,440
River spreads out wide, braiding unhindered across the

796
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:48,940
land.

797
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:59,435
One Arctic creature loves to congregate in the

798
00:45:59,435 --> 00:46:01,375
patches of brush hugging the river.

799
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,770
Musk oxen are supremely adapted to the harsh

800
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,650
conditions of the Arctic. Their secret is a

801
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,090
dense underlayer called Kiveot. Kiveot is a prized

802
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,865
and valuable fiber, softer than cashmere and 8

803
00:46:18,865 --> 00:46:20,405
times warmer than wool.

804
00:46:25,505 --> 00:46:28,145
Their Kivyot is covered by long, coarse guard

805
00:46:28,145 --> 00:46:30,805
hairs that protect against snow, wind, and ice.

806
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,040
Both males and females have horns, but those

807
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,440
of males spread out at the base forming

808
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,680
a thick 4 inch cap of horn with

809
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,480
3 inches of bone under that. This protects

810
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,880
the brain when bulls engage in fierce battles

811
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,780
during rut.

812
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,595
At the end of the last ice age,

813
00:46:52,595 --> 00:46:55,875
musk oxen roamed widely across Northern Europe, Greenland,

814
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:58,355
Asia, and North America. But by the 19

815
00:46:58,355 --> 00:47:00,595
twenties, only a handful of herds remained in

816
00:47:00,595 --> 00:47:03,920
the world. In 1930, 34 animals were brought

817
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,880
from Greenland to Nunavuk Island, Alaska, where they

818
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,660
thrived. That population was used to successfully reestablish

819
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,120
herds across the state, and now more than

820
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,540
4,000 musk oxen exist in Alaska.

821
00:47:22,755 --> 00:47:24,675
It's hard not to get lost in wonder

822
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,235
witnessing this landscape and the creatures that call

823
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:30,160
it home. We do start to see infrastructure

824
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,540
in the distance, which can only mean one

825
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,280
thing. We are about to arrive in Deadhorse,

826
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,060
heart of Alaska's energy sector and the end

827
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,360
of the Dalton Highway.

828
00:47:46,475 --> 00:47:48,875
It's pretty remarkable that we can even come

829
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:50,795
here. The Hall Road was opened to the

830
00:47:50,795 --> 00:47:53,035
public in 1981, the same year it was

831
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:55,915
named after James w Dalton, an Alaskan engineer

832
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:59,130
heavily involved in Arctic oil exploration. But at

833
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:01,070
that time, it was only open to Suikitpack

834
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:05,290
Mountain. It wasn't until 1994 that noncommercial traffic

835
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,190
was allowed all the way here to Deadhorse.

836
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:17,505
In 1968, oil was discovered in Prudhoe Bay,

837
00:48:17,505 --> 00:48:20,225
and both the Arctic and Alaska's economy were

838
00:48:20,225 --> 00:48:21,125
changed forever.

839
00:48:21,905 --> 00:48:24,065
Along with a haul road and pipeline, an

840
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:26,405
industrial camp was needed to support operations.

841
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,900
A company called Dead Horse Haulers was contracted

842
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,980
to provide the gravel for a landing strip,

843
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,200
and the name stuck.

844
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,460
Dead Horse is not a town. This place

845
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,180
is all business. Workers fly in for 2

846
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,940
to 3 week shifts, then fly home for

847
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,995
the same amount of time off. When they're

848
00:48:42,995 --> 00:48:45,255
here, they work all day, every day.

849
00:48:46,035 --> 00:48:49,095
There's a post office, general store, gas station,

850
00:48:49,235 --> 00:48:52,595
and a few hotels. Everything else here speaks

851
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:56,630
to the massive operation underway. Since 1977, the

852
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:59,130
oil fields of Prudhoe Bay have produced 18,500,000,000

853
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,330
barrels of crude oil.

854
00:49:09,845 --> 00:49:12,085
Filling the tank here represents a full loop

855
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:14,245
in the energy system. In a twist of

856
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:17,045
irony, fuel is very expensive right at the

857
00:49:17,045 --> 00:49:18,665
place it is pumped out of the ground.

858
00:49:19,045 --> 00:49:20,805
That is because the oil is not refined

859
00:49:20,805 --> 00:49:22,985
here. It must be sent down the pipeline,

860
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:26,280
shipped from Valdez to refinery, then trucked all

861
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,360
the way back up the Dalton to arrive

862
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,220
here in its consumable form.

863
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,705
Here in Deadhorse, wildlife mingles with industry, a

864
00:49:37,705 --> 00:49:41,245
bizarre juxtaposition and a reminder of just exactly

865
00:49:41,305 --> 00:49:42,365
where we are.

866
00:49:44,185 --> 00:49:46,505
The Arctic Ocean lies just a few miles

867
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:48,745
north. We are at the edge of North

868
00:49:48,745 --> 00:49:52,125
America, and that is a pretty big milestone

869
00:49:52,185 --> 00:49:54,400
for this old bus and these two artists.

870
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,760
We made it.

871
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,555
We are so happy that we made it

872
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:10,775
here in one piece, Bobby. It's amazing.

873
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:15,155
Throughout this journey, you've seen us add to

874
00:50:15,155 --> 00:50:18,275
sticker collections at key landmarks. It's a beautiful

875
00:50:18,275 --> 00:50:21,140
thing, this traveler's tradition. In a way, it

876
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,600
represents the intermingling of lives, paths, and stories.

877
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,700
All of these travelers drove the exact same

878
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,980
road, but our experiences and our stories are

879
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,160
as varied as the stickers before you.

880
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:37,435
In our story, this marks the end of

881
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:40,235
one chapter and the start of another. After

882
00:50:40,235 --> 00:50:42,315
5 years on the road, we reached the

883
00:50:42,315 --> 00:50:44,895
northernmost point we can drive in the Americas.

884
00:50:49,595 --> 00:50:51,790
Now, the mission is to reach the southernmost

885
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,510
point all the way in Ushuaia, Argentina.

886
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,610
Between here and there, a whole world of

887
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:58,670
stories awaits.

888
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,970
And the Arctic Ocean? It's just a few

889
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,105
miles north, and we have a mind to

890
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,345
jump in those icy waters to kick off

891
00:51:09,345 --> 00:51:10,965
the long journey to Argentina.

892
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,625
Join us as we literally dive in and

893
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:17,185
begin the next season and chapter of this

894

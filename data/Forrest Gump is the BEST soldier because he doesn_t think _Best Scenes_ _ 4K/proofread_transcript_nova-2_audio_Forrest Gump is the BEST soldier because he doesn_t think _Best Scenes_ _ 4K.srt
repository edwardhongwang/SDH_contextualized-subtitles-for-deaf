1  
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,740  
Gump,

2  
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,320  
what's your sole purpose in this Army?

3  
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,540  
"To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!"

4  
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,800  
"Goddammit, Gump! You're a goddamn genius!

5  
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,105  
That's the most outstanding answer I've ever heard.

6  
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:15,125  
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!"

7  
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:25,345  
"Who in the hell is that?"

8  
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:26,805  
"That there is Forrest Gump, Coach."

9  
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,830  
Now, maybe it's just me, but college was

10  
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,370  
a very confusing time.

11  
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,730  
"You ever been on a real shrimp boat?"

12  
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:38,635  
"No."

13  
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,275  
"But I've been on a real big boat."

14  
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:44,395  
"I'm talking about a shrimping boat."

15  
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:47,015  
"I've been working on shrimp boats all my

16  
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,255  
life. I started out on my uncle's boat—

17  
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:51,490  
that's my mama's brother—when I was about

18  
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,970  
maybe nine. I was thinking about buying a

19  
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,410  
boat of my own, but then I got

20  
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:55,910  
drafted."

21  
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,650  
"My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue, but people

22  
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,625  
call me Bubba."

23  
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:05,445  
"Just like one of them old redneck boys.

24  
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:08,805  
Can you believe that?"

25  
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:10,805  
"My name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump."

26  
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,165  
So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

27  
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:16,005  
and his mama cooked shrimp.

28  
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,270  
And her mama before her cooked shrimp.

29  
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,450  
And her mama before her mama cooked shrimp, too.

30  
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,410  
Bubba's family knew everything there was to

31  
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,130  
know about the shrimping business.

32  
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,150  
"I know everything there is to know about the shrimping business.

33  
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:33,325  
Matter of fact, I'm going into the shrimping

34  
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:35,725  
business for myself after I get out of the

35  
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:36,225  
Army."

36  
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,585  
"Okay, Gump!

37  
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:45,290  
What's your sole purpose in this Army?"

38  
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,430  
"To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!"

39  
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,690  
"Goddammit, Gump! You're a goddamn genius!

40  
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,010  
That's the most outstanding answer I've ever heard.

41  
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,730  
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160.

42  
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,910  
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!"

43  
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:01,755  
"Listen up, people!"

44  
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,135  
Now, for some reason, I fit in the

45  
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:06,855  
Army like one of them round pegs.

46  
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:09,335  
It's not really hard.

47  
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:11,515  
You just make your bed real neat, remember to stand up straight,

48  
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:15,255  
and always answer every question with "Yes, Drill

49  
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:19,110  
Sergeant!"

50  
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,730  
"What you do is you just drag your

51  
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,130  
nets along the bottom. On a good day,

52  
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,310  
you can catch over 100 pounds of shrimp.

53  
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,615  
Everything goes all right. Two men shrimping ten

54  
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:32,715  
hours—less if you use shrimping boats."

55  
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:36,235  
"Done, Drill Sergeant!"

56  
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,295  
"Why did you put that weapon together so

57  
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:42,910  
quickly, Gump?"

58  
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,870  
"Because you told me to, Drill Sergeant."

59  
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,870  
"Jesus H. Christ! This is a new

60  
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,870  
company record! If it wouldn't be a waste

61  
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,270  
of such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd

62  
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,270  
recommend you for OCS, Private Gump!

63  
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,730  
You are gonna be a general someday, Gump!

64  
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,130  
Now, disassemble your weapon and continue!"

65  
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:01,405  
"Anyway, like I was saying, shrimp is the

66  
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:04,465  
fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it,

67  
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:07,805  
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

68  
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:12,225  
There's shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo,

69  
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,520  
pan-fried, deep-fried, stir-fried.

70  
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,840  
There's pineapple shrimp,

71  
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,520  
lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup,

72  
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,920  
shrimp stew, shrimp salad,

73  
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,920  
shrimp and potatoes,

74  
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:31,205  
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich.

75  
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,765  
That's—that's about it."

76  
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960  
And every time I went back looking for

77  
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,400  
Bubba, somebody else was saying, "Help me, Forrest!

78  
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,140  
Help me!"

79  
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:56,475  
I...

80  
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:12,360  
started to get scared that I might never

81  
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,640  
find Bubba.

82  
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,760  
"Bravo Company, this is Delta Six! Over.

83  
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,600  
We got Charlie all over this area!

84  
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,080  
I gotta have those fast movers in here now! Over!"

85  
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,935  
"Lieutenant Dan, call this in!"

86  
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:28,575  
"I know he's dead! My whole goddamn platoon is

87  
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:30,275  
wiped out!"

88  
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:33,155  
"What are you doing?"

89  
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,415  
"You leave me here! Get away! Just leave

90  
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:39,190  
me here! Get out!"

91  
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,550  
"God, I said leave me here! Goddammit!"

92  
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,970  
"Leg wounded, sir! Leg wounded!"

93  
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,450  
"Be advised your fast movers are inbound at this time. Over."

94  
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,690  
Then it felt like something just jumped up and

95  
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,190  
bit me.

96  
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:02,925  
"Ah, something bit me!"

97  
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:04,525  
"Dear God!"

98  
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,510  
"I can't leave the platoon! I told you

99  
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,310  
to leave me there, Gump! Forget about me!

100  
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,790  
Get yourself out!"

101  
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,330  
"Did you hear what I

102  
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,330  
said?"

103  
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,110  
"Goddammit! Put me down!"

104  
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,650  
"Get your ass out of here!"

105  
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:23,825  
"Get your ass out of here!"

106  
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:25,185  
"I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,

107  
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,105  
goddamn you! Where the hell do you think

108  
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:29,605  
you're going? Get Bubba!"

109  
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,505  
"I got an airstrike inbound right now!

110  
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:32,005  
They're gonna napalm the whole area!"

111  
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,105  
"Don't you stay here! Goddammit! That's an

112  
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:37,285  
order!"

113  
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:38,285  
"I gotta find Bubba!"

114  
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:54,335  
"Forrest..."

115  
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:05,215  
"Hey, Forrest..."

116  
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:07,055  
"I'm okay..."

117  
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,080  
"Ah, no... no... I'm gonna be alright..."

118  
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,595  
If I'd known this was gonna be

119  
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,355  
the last time me and Bubba were gonna

120  
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,835  
talk, I'd have thought of something better to

121  
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,535  
say.

122  
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:31,535  
"Hey, Bubba..."

123  
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,350  
"Hey, Forrest..."

124  
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,390  
"Forrest,

125  
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,430  
why did this happen?"

126  
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,150  
"You got shot."

127  
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:47,985  
Then Bubba said something I won't ever forget.

128  
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:50,465  
"I wanna go home."

129  
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:54,865  
Bubba was my best good friend,

130  
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,420  
and even I know that ain't something you

131  
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,120  
can find just around the corner.

132  
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,260  
Bubba was gonna be a shrimping boat

133  
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,080  
captain, but

134  
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,780  
instead, he died right there by that river in Vietnam.

135  
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,395  
"Are you telling me you're the owner of

136  
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:16,675  
the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation?"

137  
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:18,295  
"Yes, sir. We got more money than Davy Crockett."

138  
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:22,675  
"Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,

139  
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,295  
but that tops them all!"

140  
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,120  
"We were sitting next to a millionaire!"

141  
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,840  
"Well,

142  
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,920  
I thought it was a very lovely story,

143  
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,060  
and you tell it so well, with such

144  
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,560  
enthusiasm."

145  
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:46,275  
"Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan

146  
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:49,175  
looks like?"

147  
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:50,175  
"Well, yes, I would."

148  
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:55,575  
"That's him right there."

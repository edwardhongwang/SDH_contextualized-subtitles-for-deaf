1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,740
Girl,

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,320
what's your sole purpose in this army? To

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,540
do whatever you tell, my drill sergeant? Goddamn

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,800
it, Gump. You're a goddamn genius. That's the

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,105
most outstanding answer I've ever heard. You must

6
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:15,125
have a goddamn IQ of a 160.

7
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:25,345
Who in the hell is that? Down there

8
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:26,805
is Forrest Gump, coach.

9
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,830
Now maybe it's just me, but college was

10
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,370
very confusing times.

11
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,730
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

12
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:38,635
No.

13
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,275
But I've been on a real big boat.

14
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:44,395
I'm talking about a shrimp catching, but

15
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:47,015
I've been working on shrimp boats all my

16
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,255
life. I started out on my uncle's boat.

17
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:51,490
That's my mama's brother when I was about

18
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,970
maybe 9. I was just looking in the

19
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,410
buying a boat of my own and got

20
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:55,910
drafted.

21
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,650
My given name is Benjamin Beaufort Blue. People

22
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,625
call me Bubba.

23
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:05,445
Just like one of them old redneck boys.

24
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:08,805
Can you believe that? My name's Forrest Gump.

25
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:10,805
People call me Forrest Gump.

26
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,165
So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama

27
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:16,005
and his mama cooked shrimp.

28
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,270
And her mama before her cooked shrimp.

29
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,450
And her mama before her mama cooked shrimp

30
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,410
too. Bubba's family knew everything there was to

31
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,130
know about the shrimping business. I know everything

32
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,150
there is to know about the shrimping business.

33
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:33,325
Matter of fact, I'm going into the shrimping

34
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:35,725
business for myself after I get out the

35
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:36,225
army.

36
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,585
Okay. Girl,

37
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:45,290
what's your sole purpose in this army? To

38
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,430
do whatever you tell my drill sergeant? Goddamn

39
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,690
it, Gump. You're a goddamn genius. That's the

40
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,010
most outstanding answer I've ever heard. You must

41
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,730
have a goddamn IQ of a 160. You

42
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,910
are goddamn gifted, Private Gump.

43
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:01,755
Listen up people.

44
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,135
Now for some reason I fit in the

45
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:06,855
army like one of them round pegs. It's

46
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:09,335
not really hard. You just make your bed

47
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:11,515
real neat and remember to stand up straight,

48
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:15,255
and always answer every question with, yes, drill

49
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:19,110
sergeant. Isn't that clear? Yes, drill sergeant.

50
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,730
What you do is you just drag your

51
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,130
nets along the buck. On a good day,

52
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,310
you can catch over a Â£100 of shrimp.

53
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,615
Everything goes alright. 2 men shrimp in 10

54
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:32,715
hours. Less with 2 shimps on gas.

55
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:36,235
Tundra, sergeant? Yes. Go on.

56
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,295
Why did you put that weapon together so

57
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:42,910
quickly, god? You tell me to do your

58
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,870
target? Jesus H Christ. This is a new

59
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,870
company record. If it wouldn't be a waste

60
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,870
of such a damn fine enlisted men, I'd

61
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,270
recommend you for OCS Private Gump. You are

62
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,270
gonna be a general someday Gump. Now, there's

63
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,730
a simple your weapon to continue.

64
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:01,405
Anyway, like I was saying, shrimp is the

65
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:04,465
fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it,

66
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:07,805
boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it.

67
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:12,225
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo,

68
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,520
pan fried, deep fried, stir

69
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,840
fried. There's pineapple shrimp,

70
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,520
lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup,

71
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,920
shrimp stew, shrimp salad,

72
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,920
shrimp and potatoes,

73
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:31,205
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich.

74
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,765
That's that's about it.

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
And every time I went back looking for

76
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,400
Bubba, somebody else was saying, help me, Forrest.

77
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,140
Help me.

78
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:56,475
I

79
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:12,360
started to get scared that I might never

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,640
find Buckle. Back there, over. Strong-arm. I know

81
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,760
my position is danger close. We got Charlie

82
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,600
all over this area. I gotta have those

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,080
fast movers in here now, over. Jack, strong-arm.

84
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,935
We want Lieutenant dad, call this dad. I

85
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:28,575
know he's dead. My old goddamn platoon is

86
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:30,275
wiped out. What

87
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:33,155
are you doing? What are you doing?

88
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,415
You'll leave me here. Get away. Just leave

89
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:39,190
me here. Get out. Strong-arm. I'll tell him.

90
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,550
God, I said leave me here. Goddamn it.

91
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,970
Likely, mister. Likely, mister. Strong-arm. Be advised your

92
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,450
passengers are inbound at this time. Over. Then

93
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,690
it felt like something just jumped up and

94
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,190
bit

95
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:02,925
think son of a bitch?

96
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:04,525
Yes.

97
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,510
I can't leave the platoon. I told you

98
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,310
to leave me there, Gump. Forget about me.

99
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,790
Get yourself out. Did you hear what I

100
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,290
said?

101
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,330
Goddamn it. Put me down.

102
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,650
Get your ass out of here.

103
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:23,825
Get your ass out of here. I didn't

104
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:25,185
ask you to pull me out of there.

105
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,105
Goddamn you. Where the hell do you think

106
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:29,605
you're going? Get Bob. I got an airstrike

107
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,505
inbound right now. They're gonna nape the whole

108
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:32,005
area.

109
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,105
Don't you stay here. Goddamn it. That's an

110
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:37,285
order. I gotta find Bob.

111
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:54,335
Forest.

112
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:05,215
Okay, Forest.

113
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:07,055
I'm okay.

114
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,080
Uh-oh. But no. No. I'm gonna be alright.

115
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,595
If I'd have known this was gonna be

116
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,355
the last time me and Bubba was gonna

117
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,835
talk, I'd have thought of something better to

118
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,535
say. Hey, Bubba.

119
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,350
Hey, Forrest.

120
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,390
Forrest,

121
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,430
why didn't this happen?

122
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,150
You got shot.

123
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:47,985
Then Bubba said something I won't ever forget.

124
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:50,465
I wanna go home.

125
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:54,865
Bubba was my best good friend,

126
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,420
and even I know that ain't something you

127
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,120
can find just around the corner.

128
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,260
Bubba was gonna be a shrimp and buck

129
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,080
captain, but

130
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,780
instead, he died right there by that rhythm

131
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,440
of Vietnam.

132
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,395
Are you telling me you're the owner of

133
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:16,675
the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation? Yes, sir. We

134
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:18,295
got more money than the David Crockett.

135
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:22,675
Boy, I heard some bumpers in my time,

136
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,295
but that tops them all.

137
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,120
We were sitting next to a millionaire.

138
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,840
Well,

139
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,920
I thought it was a very lovely story,

140
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,060
and you tell it so well with such

141
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,560
enthusiasm.

142
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:46,275
Would you like to see what Loutek Dan

143
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:49,175
looks like? Well, yes. I would.

144
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:55,575
That's him right there.
